## Biolabs and Bombs?

Nuclear rhetoric is a milestone of the Russian government's communication strategies used to justify its unprovoked and unlawful aggression against Ukraine. While claiming that it fights against the NATO expression and threats it causes, it also states that Ukraine solemnly poses a threat to Russian security by having biolaboratories for the development of biological weapons and strives to obtain a “dirty bomb.” The IAEA[^128] has repeatedly refuted Russian disinformation regarding nuclear provocations or nuclear safety violations by Ukraine. This accusation was immediately denied by the Ministry of Defense and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine.  

## Budapest Memorandum

After the signing of the Budapest Memorandum,[^129] Ukraine completely renounced nuclear weapons. Russia, as a nuclear state, undertook the commitment in the form of security assurances to respect the independence and sovereignty of Ukraine’s borders. Besides, Ukraine doesn’t possess the capabilities to create a nuclear bomb. It had enriched uranium only for scientific purposes, but from 2010 until 2012, the removal of 128 kilograms (over 280 pounds) of HEU from two remaining sites in Ukraine took place. The deliveries were finalized through a collaborative initiative with Ukraine, fulfilling the pledges made by Presidents Obama and Yanukovych during the 2010 Nuclear Security Summit to eliminate all of Ukraine’s HEU  by the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.[^130]

## Nuclear Power Plants

The purpose of disinformation about the nuclear disaster in Ukraine is to discredit the Ukrainian authorities for their alleged inability to maintain safety at nuclear facilities. In this way, Russia is trying to portray Ukraine as unreliable and dangerous. Facts about Ukraine storing weapons at nuclear power plants, shelling nuclear facilities, or intending to obtain nuclear weapons are intended to prove that it is Ukraine that is posing a danger and blackmailing the world with a nuclear catastrophe, not Russia. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was captured on the 4 of March 2022  under the control of the Russian army. They place military equipment,[^131] rocket launching systems,[^132] and troops[^133] in the territory of the plant and the Russian troops are shelling Ukrainian targets from there, knowing that the Ukrainians will not shoot back so as not to jeopardize the nuclear facilities.[^134] This causes a permanent threat not only to Ukrainian security but to the European one, too.
