Without any regard to the norm that *“the civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against the dangers arising from military operations*”[^warcrimes-civilians-1] The Russian military committed horrible crimes against civilians. Here just a few examples:

## Butcha (2022, Butcha)

See @sec-denial-bucha.


## Kramatorsk (2022, April 8th)

For the russian attack on the Kramatorsk railroad station with cluster ammunition see @sec-denial-kramatorsk.  


## Kremenchuk (2022, June 27th)

See @sec-denial-kremenchuk.



## Chasiv Yar (2022, July 9th)
