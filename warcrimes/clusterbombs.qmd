# Warcrimes â€“ cluster munitions {#sec-warcrimes-clusterbombs}

::: {.callout-caution title="Myth"}
- Russia never uses cluster munitions in Ukraine because of humanitarian concerns
- Ukraine shouldn't use forbidden cluster munitions because that puts civilians at risk in Ukraine

::: {.callout-tip title="Truth"}
- Russia is targeting civilians in Ukraine directly cluster munitions since its invasion: that's a war crime
- Without having signed the Convention on Cluster Munitions, Ukraine may legally use cluster munitions against military targets to defend itself
- The greatest danger to the Ukrainian civilian population comes from the large areas that Russia has mined in Ukraine, not from the remains of Ukrainian cluster munitions
