The Protocol[^warcrimes-infrastructure-1] also states that “*indiscriminate attacks are prohibited. Indiscriminate attacks are those things that are not directed at a specific military objective”*. The Russian army attacked numerous civil infrastructure objects. On 6 June, 2023 took place an attack, which is impressive not only in the number of victims but also in the scale of the consequences \- blew up the Kakhovka HPP[^warcrimes-infrastructure-2] in the Kherson region. According to the latest data, at least 32 people were killed in the controlled territory of Ukraine alone, the situation is much worse in the occupied part. In addition to human casualties, the destruction of hydroelectric power plants has serious environmental consequences[^warcrimes-infrastructure-3].  

Since October 2022 Russia has been waging a campaign aimed at destroying the Ukrainian critical infrastructure namely electricity and heat generation and its distribution. During October–March 2022 in accordance with Ministry of energy data about 50% of the energy infrastructure was damaged by shelling[^warcrimes-infrastructure-4]. Lately, On 22 March 2024 Russia launched one of the largest missile and drone attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, targeting at least 10 regions of the country. Since then, Russia has struck Ukrainian power plants across the country, and on 28 March destroyed the Trypilska TPP, the largest power plant in the Kyiv region[^warcrimes-infrastructure-5].
