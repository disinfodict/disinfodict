*Urbicide* is the deliberate destruction or annihilation of a city, its infrastructure, or its urban fabric, often as a strategy in warfare or conflict to undermine the social, cultural, or economic life of its inhabitants. The term combines "urban" and "-cide" (from Latin, meaning killing) and is used to describe acts like targeted bombings, sieges, or systematic dismantling of urban spaces, typically with political or ethnic motives.
