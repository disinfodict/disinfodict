## World War I

The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and his wife in Sarajevo is considered the trigger for World War I.

> With the assassination, the Serbian Pan-Slavists, supported by Russia, wanted to once again make clear their demand for a Serbian nation state independent of Austria-Hungary.[^wwii-responsibility-1] 


## World War II

### Hitler-Stalin Pact

The Hitler-Stalin Pact was also known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact:

> The Hitler-Stalin Pact had far-reaching consequences for the whole of Europe: it not only paved the way for the German invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, which marked the beginning of World War II. The secret additional protocol also provided for the division of the countries of Eastern and Central Europe into spheres of influence between Hitler's Germany and the Soviet Union, marking the beginning of a period of tyranny for millions of people that did not end until 1989/90.[^wwii-responsibility-2]


> It was not until after World War II that the secret additional protocol to the Hitler-Stalin Pact became known. In the Warsaw Pact countries, the existence of the agreement was denied until 1989. Documents proving its authenticity were dismissed as Western propaganda and forgeries.[^wwii-responsibility-3]
