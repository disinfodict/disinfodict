## World War I

The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and his wife in Sarajevo is considered the trigger for World War I.

> With the assassination, the Serbian Pan-Slavists, supported by Russia, wanted to once again make clear their demand for a Serbian nation state independent of Austria-Hungary.[^wwii-responsibility-1] 


## World War II

### Hitler-Stalin Pact

The Hitler-Stalin Pact was also known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact:

> The Hitler-Stalin Pact had far-reaching consequences for the whole of Europe: it not only paved the way for the German invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, which marked the beginning of World War II. The secret additional protocol also provided for the division of the countries of Eastern and Central Europe into spheres of influence between Hitler's Germany and the Soviet Union, marking the beginning of a period of tyranny for millions of people that did not end until 1989/90.[^wwii-responsibility-2]


> It was not until after World War II that the secret additional protocol to the Hitler-Stalin Pact became known. In the Warsaw Pact countries, the existence of the agreement was denied until 1989. Documents proving its authenticity were dismissed as Western propaganda and forgeries.[^wwii-responsibility-3]

Germany had declared the [German–Polish declaration of non-aggression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%E2%80%93Polish_declaration_of_non-aggression) invalid on April 28, 1939, secured the support of the Soviet Union on August 23, 1939, and invaded Poland on September 1, 1939. The Soviet Union broke the  [Soviet–Polish Non-Aggression Pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93Polish_Non-Aggression_Pact) by signing the Hitler-Stalin Pact on August 24, 1939, and invading Poland on September 17, 1939. 
To this day, the Hitler-Stalin Pact remains a blind spot on the map of Germans, who have by no means adequately processed their past:[^wwii-responsibility-5]

> However, the history of perceptions of the two-year murderous alliance between Hitler and Stalin shows that European memory politics—especially German-Russian memory politics—still have major gaps today. In propaganda and the history of perception, the “devil's pact” (Julián Gorkin) was woven into the greatest web of lies of the 20th century, as French historian Jean-Jacques Marie [described](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD9LpH0iork).

> The success story of the Soviet Union as the victorious power in World War II continues to overshadow and suppress the alliance and cooperation between fascism and Stalinism in the official “German-Soviet friendship,” and German leniency toward Stalinism further contributes to this amnesia.

> Lies and propaganda narratives, relativizations, or outright denials spread by interested parties have contributed to the fact that historical research is still far from a comprehensive understanding of the “pact with the devil.” Legitimizing narratives remain en vogue.

> Today, documents from Russian secret archives raise new questions. Had Stalin not already set out much earlier than 1939 to reach a lasting agreement with Nazi Germany? Was there not a secretly pursued plan? A secret meeting at the Russian embassy on Unter den Linden in February 1933 shows that Moscow abandoned Hitler's opponents without a word shortly after Hitler's “seizure of power,” thereby betraying its own comrades.

> Beyond the joint destruction of Poland and the agreed subjugation of Eastern Central Europe, German-Russian cooperation included logistical support for the Wehrmacht's campaigns of conquest through the supply of oil, industrial raw materials, and grain from the Soviet Union and other states, the destruction of democracies, the weakening of the anti-Hitler opposition and resistance, the liquidation of left-wing solidarity, and the extradition of Hitler's opponents to the Gestapo.

## World War III

The unprovoked, large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, aimed at conquest and destruction, will one day be regarded by historians as the beginning of World War III [![Link to Wikipedia](../all_common_img/Wikipedia.png){height=1em}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_war_(2022–present))
