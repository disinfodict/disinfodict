Pro-Russian propaganda labels Ukraine as an undemocratic, authoritarian, or even totalitarian country. By doing so, the creators of disinformation try to discredit the Ukrainian state and halt the support it receives from partner countries and even Ukrainians themselves. 

However, Ukraine has no persecution of individuals based on religion, nationality, or language under its Constitution. People are free to use any language in their everyday lives and practice a religion of their choice. Moreover, if Ukraine had been under a totalitarian government or dictatorship, as Russians claim to call the Ukrainian government the “Kiev regime”[^democracy-ukraine-1] it's unlikely that the West would have extended its assistance to it. 


## Election of the Hetmans

Unlike Russian Zarism, Ukraine has a history with an early form of democracy: elected Hetmans, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cossack_Hetmanate).


## Independence

Ukraine has declared its desire to separate from the Russian undemocratic regime long ago, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Ukrainian_independence_referendum). The results of the 1991 Ukrainian independence referendum showcase the will of the people to live in an independent and democratic country.

## Change of government

Unlike Russia, Ukraine has enjoyed several peaceful democratic changes of government since its independence, see [Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geschichte_der_Ukraine_(seit_1991)).


## EU Accession

Ukraine has a long path to go in terms of democratic reforms. This has been intensified by two major events \- “Orange revolution”in 2004 against election fraud and “Revolution of dignity” (Maidan) in 2013-2014 against the refusal of the agreement with the EU.[^democracy-ukraine-2]

Significant strides have been made in enhancing democracy on a local scale, with the decentralization reform giving rise to ‘hromadas’, administrative entities at the local level that guarantee more resources and autonomy for community decision-making.

The biggest progress in democratic reforms is made due to the Ukrainian determination to integrate with the EU, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accession_of_Ukraine_to_the_European_Union). Ukraine obtained the candidate status on the 23 of June 2022\. The larger path of membership negotiations was outlined by implementing 7 criteria that were determined by the European Commission. According to the results of the fulfillment of the criteria by Ukraine, the European Commission recommended starting negotiations on entry on November 8, 2023, with technical reservations, regarding the criteria, where Ukraine is to achieve broader progress, namely in the fight against corruption[^democracy-ukraine-3].
