::: {.callout-tip title="Truth"}
- The name *Truth Social* aligns with 5 of Umberto Eco's criteria for fascism (says Elon Musk's Grok)
- The moderation and content of *Truth Social* aligns with all of Umberto Eco's criteria for fascism, with half of them strongly (says Elon Musk's Grok)
:::

We asked Grok-3 to evaluate the name "Truth Social" in the context of Umberto Eco's 14 criteria of fascism.[^nazis-truthsocial-1-en] Grok concluded 

> The name "Truth Social" aligns most closely with Eco’s Criteria 4 (disagreement as treason), 6 (appeal to social frustration), 7 (obsession with a plot), 13 (selective populism), and 14 (Newspeak). It suggests a potential to foster a singular narrative that could exclude dissent and appeal to a frustrated group, but the name alone isn’t enough to label it fascist—it’s a starting point for deeper scrutiny.

and then Grok suggested to also evaluate the platform content. Grok concluded

> Truth Social’s content aligns strongly with Eco’s Criteria 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, and 14, with elements of Criteria 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, and 12. Its focus on a singular "truth," suppression of dissent, conspiracies, and appeal to a frustrated demographic reflect fascist tendencies. While its reach is limited, it warrants scrutiny as a potential incubator for such ideologies, given Trump’s influence.


## The Name "Truth Social"

This document evaluates the name "Truth Social," associated with a social media platform launched by Donald Trump in 2022, using Umberto Eco's 14 criteria of fascism as outlined in his 1995 essay "Ur-Fascism".

### Relevant Criteria and Analysis

- **1. The Cult of Tradition**  
   Eco describes fascism as rooted in a reverence for tradition, where truth is seen as unchangeable. The name "Truth Social" suggests a claim to an absolute "truth," potentially aligning with this criterion if the platform positions itself as a guardian of a singular, traditionalist narrative. However, the name alone doesn’t explicitly invoke tradition.

- **2. Rejection of Modernism**  
   Fascism often rejects Enlightenment values like reason and progress, favoring irrationalism. "Truth Social" implies a counter-narrative to mainstream discourse, which might resonate with rejecting modern, evidence-based consensus (e.g., scientific or media establishments). The name itself doesn’t directly signal this rejection.

- **4. Disagreement is Treason**  
   In fascist ideologies, dissent is betrayal. "Truth Social" could imply a monolithic "truth" that doesn’t tolerate deviation—suggesting dissenters are outside the "social" circle of truth. This criterion may apply if the platform suppresses opposing views, though the name alone isn’t conclusive.

- **5. Fear of Difference**  
   Fascism rejects "the other." While "Truth Social" doesn’t explicitly target outsiders, its branding as a space for a specific "truth" might exclude those who don’t share that worldview, potentially fostering an us-versus-them mentality. This depends on the platform’s operations, not just the name.

- **6. Appeal to Social Frustration**  
   Fascism appeals to a frustrated middle class. "Truth Social" emerged where Trump’s base felt marginalized by "elites." The name could resonate with this group by offering a suppressed "truth," indirectly aligning with this criterion through its audience.

- **7. Obsession with a Plot**  
   Fascism often involves conspiracy beliefs. "Truth Social" might appeal to those believing in plots like "the deep state" or "fake news media," common in Trump’s rhetoric. The name’s focus on "truth" could signal a mission to counter these plots, making this criterion relevant.

- **8. The Enemy is Both Strong and Weak**  
   Fascists depict enemies as powerful yet feeble. The name "Truth Social" doesn’t directly reflect this, but if the platform portrays media or opponents as oppressive yet easily defeated by the "truth," this criterion could apply.

- **13. Selective Populism**  
   Fascism uses "the People" as a monolithic entity, with the leader interpreting their will. "Truth Social" might position itself as the voice of "the People" against a corrupt establishment, aligning with selective populism. The name’s focus on "social" hints at a collective identity.

- **14. Ur-Fascism Speaks Newspeak**  
   Eco references Orwell’s Newspeak, where language limits critical thinking. "Truth Social" could be seen as Newspeak if it implies a simplified, unchallenged "truth" that discourages complex reasoning, fitting this criterion to some extent.

### Other Criteria and Their Relevance

Criteria like the cult of action (3), pacifism as trafficking with the enemy (9), contempt for the weak (10), everybody educated to be a hero (11), or machismo (12) don’t directly connect to the name "Truth Social." These traits are more about behavior than branding.

### Broader Context and Implications

The name "Truth Social" suggests a mission to control "truth," a red flag in Eco’s framework. Fascist regimes claim a monopoly on truth to suppress dissent (Criteria 4, 13, 14). The platform’s association with Trump, whose rhetoric includes xenophobia and conspiracy-mongering (Criteria 5, 6, 7), adds weight. However, the name alone doesn’t embody all criteria—it’s a signal of potential fascist tendencies.

### Critical Reflection

Eco warns that fascism can appear subtly, and not all criteria need to be present. "Truth Social" might foster division, exclude dissent, and align with fascist tendencies like Newspeak or selective populism. Alternatively, the name could be a marketing choice without deeper ideological intent. The name’s alignment with Eco’s criteria is suggestive but not definitive without analyzing the platform’s content.


## Content of Truth Social Platform

This document analyzes the content of the Truth Social platform in the context of Umberto Eco's 14 criteria of fascism, as outlined in his 1995 essay "Ur-Fascism". The analysis focuses on Truth Social's content, user behavior, and moderation practices, using available information as of May 16, 2025.


### Relevant Criteria and Content Analysis

- **1. The Cult of Tradition**
Eco describes fascism as emphasizing a reverence for tradition, where truth is fixed. Truth Social appeals to conservative users with a MAGA focus, often glorifying "American principles." Its initial hosting by RightForge, a company tied to traditionalist values, and content nostalgic for a "golden age" align with this criterion.

- **2. Rejection of Modernism**
Fascism rejects Enlightenment values, favoring irrationalism. Truth Social amplifies conspiracy theories, like QAnon and alien lizard people narratives on its Truth+ streaming service, dismissing scientific consensus and mainstream media as "fake news." This reflects a rejection of modern critical thinking.

- **3. The Cult of Action for Action’s Sake**
Fascism values action over reflection. Truth Social has hosted content inciting action, like Trump’s 2023 post predicting his arrest and urging protest, echoing January 6 rhetoric. Its initial Google Play rejection in 2022 for violating policies against violence suggests a tendency to promote impulsive behavior.

- **4. Disagreement is Treason**
Fascism equates dissent with betrayal. Truth Social bans accounts criticizing Trump, such as those posting about January 6 hearings or pro-choice views. Recent X posts note users like \@HealthRanger being banned for critiquing Trump’s tariffs, showing suppression of dissent and alignment with this criterion.

- **5. Fear of Difference**
Fascism rejects "the other." Truth Social’s user base (77% white, 65% over 55, per 2024 GWS Magnify analysis) and content often target "enemies" like the "deep state" or liberal elites. Its links to QAnon and concerns about antisemitic content suggest an us-versus-them mentality, fitting this criterion.

- **6. Appeal to Social Frustration**
Fascism appeals to a frustrated middle class. Truth Social emerged after Trump’s bans from Twitter and Facebook, tapping into MAGA supporters’ feelings of censorship by "Big Tech." Its content rails against elites, resonating with a disenfranchised demographic and aligning with this criterion.

- **7. Obsession with a Plot**
Fascism involves conspiracy beliefs. Truth Social hosts QAnon content, promoted by Trump, alleging elite cabals, alongside Truth+ documentaries about alien lizard people and Jesus as an alien. This obsession with plots against "the People" strongly fits this criterion.

- **8. The Enemy is Both Strong and Weak**
Fascists depict enemies as powerful yet feeble. Truth Social content portrays media and liberals as oppressive ("Big Tech tyranny") but easily defeated by the "truth." Trump’s rhetoric, dominant on the platform, reflects this dual portrayal.

- **9. Pacifism is Trafficking with the Enemy**
Fascism views pacifism as collaboration. Truth Social’s tolerance for violent rhetoric, leading to its 2022 Google Play rejection, and bans on accounts discussing January 6 hearings suggest a rejection of de-escalation narratives, indirectly fitting this criterion.

- **10. Contempt for the Weak**
Fascism shows disdain for the weak. Truth Social’s Trump-influenced content mocks opponents’ perceived weakness, such as liberal figures. Its conservative user base may reflect cultural disdain for vulnerability, though direct evidence is limited.

- **11. Everybody is Educated to Become a Hero**
Fascism educates followers to see themselves as heroes. Truth Social frames users as defenders of "truth" against a corrupt establishment, with Trump as the ultimate hero. Its appeal to MAGA supporters encourages a heroic self-image in a struggle against oppression.

- **12. Machismo**
Fascism promotes machismo and traditional gender roles. Truth Social’s user base (57% male) and Trump’s hyper-masculine rhetoric reflect this trait. Its strict policies against sexual content, while banning pro-choice posts, suggest a conservative stance on gender and sexuality.

- **13. Selective Populism**
Fascism uses "the People" as a monolithic entity. Truth Social’s "big tent" claim is undermined by its conservative user base and Trump-aligned content. It positions itself as the voice of "the People" against elites, but bans critics, showing selective populism.

- **14. Ur-Fascism Speaks Newspeak**
Eco references Orwell’s Newspeak, where language limits critical thinking. Truth Social’s terms—"Truths," "ReTruths," "sponsored truths"—imply an unchallenged "truth." By banning dissent and promoting conspiracies, it reduces discourse to simplistic, binary narratives, aligning with Newspeak.

### Broader Context and Implications  

Truth Social’s content reflects Trump’s influence, focusing on anti-establishment narratives, conspiracies, and exclusionary rhetoric. Its moderation suppresses dissent while amplifying Trump-aligned voices, creating an echo chamber. This aligns with Criteria 4, 5, 7, 13, and 14, with concerns raised by *The Independent* about its "threat to democracy." However, its small user base (5 million website visitors, 1 million app users as of February 2024) and financial struggles limit its impact.

### Critical Reflection  

Eco warns that fascism can manifest subtly, and not all criteria need to be present. Truth Social exhibits troubling traits: suppression of dissent, conspiracies, and us-versus-them rhetoric. Its limited reach and operational challenges, as noted by *Newsweek* and *Britannica*, temper its impact, but its role as a megaphone for Trump’s rhetoric makes it a space where fascist-like traits can fester.
