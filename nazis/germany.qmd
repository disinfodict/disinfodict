    Did you know that there are far more Nazis in Germany than in Ukraine? What if Russia wants to de-Nazify them all?

::: {.callout-tip title="Truth"}
- Russia supports extreme left-wing and right-wing parties in Germany
- Russia wants to divide the Germans, influence German politics, come to power
- With the success of right-wing parties, Russia creates a pretext to invade Germany
:::

Russia is using the lie that Ukraine is ruled by Nazis as a pretext to invade Ukraine, see @sec-nazis-ukraine. In fact, Russia itself is ruled by fascists, see @sec-nazis-ukraine. By now we know what Russia does to a country where only 3% vote Nazi: invade it and commit war crimes (@sec-warcrimes-intro), mine it and bomb the civilian population (@sec-denial-intro), plan and carry out genocide (@sec-genocide-announced, @sec-genocide-ongoing), set up filtration camps, re-education camps and torture camps. 

East Germany was never de-Nazified. There were officially no Nazis in the GDR, they supposedly only existed "in the West". In West Germany, the past was dealt with and democracy was practiced. In East Germany, 12 years of right-wing dictatorship were followed by 41 years of left-wing dictatorship. After reunification, Nazis moved from West Germany to East Germany and created "nationally liberated zones", i.e. certain streets, residential areas,
villages or rural areas in which the right-wing has cultural hegemony and the "rule of the street".

In the meantime, the pro-Russian far-right AfD, which is classified as "anti-constitutional",[^nazis-germany-1-en] has become the strongest party in East Germany. It achieved 32% in the 2025 federal election. Overall, the pro-Russian parties (with BSW and Linke) achieved 54.7% in eastern Germany. 

Anyone who votes for a far-right party in Germany or agitates against support for Ukraine should consider what kind of massacre Russia is likely to cause in a federal state where not 3% but 30% of the population voted for Nazis?
