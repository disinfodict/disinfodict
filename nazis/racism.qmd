## Antisemitism

Russia has such a huge history of antisemitism, that there are three Wikipedia articles devoted to it: 

- [Antisemitism in the Russian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism_in_the_Russian_Empire)
- [Antisemitism in the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism_in_the_Soviet_Union)
- [Antisemitism in Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism_in_Russia)


## Pogrom

The word [Pogrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogrom) stems from russia, for a reason. In late 1800s Imperial russia started a campaign of deportations, intimidations and massacres to force Jews to abandon their land so russians could move in.

The [Protocols of the Elders of Zion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion)  was first published in a newspaper in the Russian Empire in 1903. The publisher claimed to have discovered a real document that proved there was a Jewish world conspiracy. This was not true. The [Black Hundreds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hundreds) were behind the worst antisemitic hoax in history which served to justify violent genocide of Jews.[^nazis-racism-2]

The Black Hundreds was a racist, genocidal movement that believed in conquest by divine right of white Christian Slavs whose ideology would be later adopted by Germans, becoming Nazism: 

> In many respects, the Black Hundreds shared the main ideological patterns of fascist movements in Europe. In their calls for a metaphysical unity of the nation, a return to the past, and anti-capitalist and anti-Semitic rhetoric combined with the promotion of a mythical rural authenticity and Orthodoxy[^nazis-racism-3]

[Alfred Ernst Rosenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Rosenberg) — a Baltic German Nazi theorist and ideologue — studied 1915 - 1917 in Moscow and later brought the *Protocols of the Elders of Zion* in the early 1920s to Hitler.

> The most important Black Hundreds figure, [Nikolai E. Markov (1866–1945)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Markov_(politician)), former leader of the [Union of the Russian People (UPR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_the_Russian_People) and of the rightists’ faction at the Third and Fourth Dumas, played a critical role in linking the Black Hundreds legacy to Nazism.[^nazis-racism-3] 

Amongst other activities, Markov defended the *Protocols of the Elders of Zion* in the [Berne Trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Trial).[^nazis-racism-4]


## Russification

Stalin continued racist russification of its colonies:

> As Joseph Stalin (1927–53) consolidated political power in the late 1920s, ethnic hostility gradually replaced class-enemy antagonism. The Soviet Union’s racist ideas and policies played out most forcefully in the geopolitically sensitive border zones. In 1928, officials determined to cleanse all unreliable ethnic and national groups from its borders.[^nazis-racism-3]


## Russophobia

"Russophobia" is a propaganda term used in an attempt to immunize Russification against criticism by projecting russian rassism onto opponents: The term defames critics who point out real dangers as an expression of a mentally ill fear (phobia).

## Uniformity

The russian regime loves loyalty and uniformity and hates objection and diversity.

## Slavs only

Uniformity implies a racist ideal: the white slav.

> The dominance of whiteness was on wide display in the race-conscious “Slavs Only” (tol’ko slavianam) job advertisements and apartment and room listings as well.[^nazis-racism-1]
