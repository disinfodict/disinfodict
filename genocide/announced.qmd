## Fascist manifesto

On April 3, 2022, the Russian state organ Ria Novosti published the *fascist manifesto*[^genocide-announced-2] by Timofey Sergeytsev. It calls for the cleansing of Ukraine of everything Ukrainian: the Ukrainian military, Ukrainian culture and the Ukrainian people. The central sentence

> Denazification will inevitably result in de-Ukrainization

exposes the Russian propaganda about the alleged Nazis in Ukraine for what it is: a commitment to the Russian-fascist will to destroy everything Ukrainian. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Russia_Should_Do_with_Ukraine). 


## Russian Media

Russian Media and TV publish every day calls to annihilate the Ukrainian military, Ukrainian culture and the Ukrainian people. An excellent source for this is the *Russian Media Monitor* by Julia Davis – Investigative Reporter, Russian Media Analyst and Commentator at [www.russialies.com](http://www.russialies.com).


## Crimes Against Humanity

On 2024, June 6th, six top Russian propagandists, among them a former president, are targeted by a International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) legal submission under Article 15 of the Rome Statute.[^genocide-announced-1]
