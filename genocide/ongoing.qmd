- Genocide doesn't happen
- It was not the Russians
- It doesn't qualify for Genocide
- The victims deserve it
- The victims do it themselves
- The victims do it to us (russians)

::: {.callout-tip title="Truth"}
Russia has announced and started Genocide of everyone and everything Ukrainian.
:::


> Genocide Watch is issuing an emergency alert regarding statements made by US President Donald Trump about the war in Ukraine ... Russian aggression and genocide will worsen if the US abandons Ukraine. Russia is engaged in every stage of genocide in Ukraine. Genocide Watch considers the statements made by the Trump administration to be aiding and abetting genocide. They are evidence of Stage 4: Dehumanization, Stage 5: Organization and Stage 6: Polarization. Trumpâ€™s rhetoric reflects Russian disinformation.[^genocide-ongoing-1]
