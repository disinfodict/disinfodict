## Nets save lives

> Cast your nets for a catch — Luke 5:4

Since May 2024, Kherson has been under constant attack from drones launched from the Russian-occupied bank of the Dnipro River. These drones are deliberately targeted at civilians, hospitals, residential buildings, and civilian vehicles. This [“human safari”](#sec-warcrimes-humansafari) can be countered by placing nets over roads and buildings: drones get caught in the nets (which are difficult for drone cameras to detect) instead of exploding at their target, or they stay away when they detect the nets. In this way, many lives can be saved with manageable effort.[^appendix-act-1] 

Old used fishing nets are collected and provided free of charge by Carl Futtrup in Denmark. Transport to Kherson in southern Ukraine costs around €3,000 per trip. As of December 20th 2025, 11 Semi-trailer trucks with 20 tons nets have been transported by *Fellas for Europe e.V.* together with *Osteuropahilfe der Landkreise Starnberg, Bad Tölz-Wolfratshausen und München e.V.*[^appendix-act-2] More are needed to save lives.
