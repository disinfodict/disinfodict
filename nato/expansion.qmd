    Did you know that NATO has never expanded? The countries only joined NATO. Out of fear of Russia. But NATO was too weak.

## "NATO-Expansion" is no justification

Even if there had been NATO expansion, this would not justify an invasion,[^nato-expansion-5] warcrimes (@sec-warcrimes-intro) and genocide (@sec-genocide-ongoing). NATO's real contribution to the invasion is its cowardice and weakness[^nato-expansion-6].


## "NATO-Expansion" is a propaganda term

NATO enlargement is the most common political explanation of Russian unprovoked aggression against Ukraine. However, the reason behind the NATO enlargement is that states consider Russia a threat to their security and seek protection. Russia has a history of military interventions and actions that destabilize its neighbors, fueling anxieties about security in Eastern Europe. Recent examples include the wars in Chechnya, Georgia, Syria, and the annexation of Crimea. It was these actions, not NATO expansion itself, that prompted many countries to seek protection within the alliance.

## NATO accession was legitimite

It is important to highlight that the NATO accession took place without violating any previously signed agreements with Russia. While the 1990 Two-plus-Four Treaty  addressed Germany's reunification and its NATO membership, it did not include any commitments regarding the future of other Eastern European countries. Even Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, has confirmed that no such promises were made, see @sec-nato-promise

In 1994 Russia joined the [Partnership for Peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partnership_for_Peace) and in the [NATO-Russia Founding Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia%E2%80%93NATO_relations#Founding_Act) expressly agreed to the accession of the Eastern European countries to NATO, see @sec-nato-promise.


## Ukraine was non-aligned

In 2010, during the premiership of Viktor Yanukovych, the Ukrainian parliament voted to abandon the goal of NATO membership and re-affirm Ukraine's neutral status, while continuing its co-operation with NATO.[^nato-expansion-8] In the February 2014 Ukrainian Revolution, Ukraine's parliament voted to remove Yanukovych, but the new government did not seek to change its neutral status.[^nato-expansion-1][^nato-expansion-2][^nato-expansion-3]. In other words: __Russia invaded Ukraine while Ukraine was by constitution not seeking NATO membership__.


## Sweden and Finland

Russia's struggle against NATO enlargement has led to the very expansion of the alliance. Finland and Sweden, neutral until February 24, 2022, decided to join NATO after Russia's full-scale invasion. Before this happened, NATO had land borders with Russia that spanned 1213 km across northern Norway, eastern Latvia, and Estonia, and the borders with Poland and Lithuania around Russia's Kaliningrad region.  This changed when Finland became a member state of the alliance and now the length of the NATO-Russian border is almost twice bigger — 2548 km.[^nato-expansion-4] Still, even after Finland's accession, only 11% of Russia's land border is shared with NATO countries.


## Nobody is encircling Russia

Even after the accession of Sweden and Finland, it is ridiculous to claim that NATO is encircling Russia:
