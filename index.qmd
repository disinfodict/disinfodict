The **Disinfo Dictionary (DisDict)** is a compact, clearly structured, searchable and linkable online resource that refutes recurring Russian narratives about Russia's war against Ukraine with selected facts, thus complementing the very extensive [EUvsDisinfo database](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/disinformation-cases/) of the EU diplomatic service and Wikipedia: DisDict is a **time-saving tool for journalists, for fact-checkers, for activists against disinformation, for users of social networks and for all citizens looking for reliable information about Russia and Ukraine**.  DisDict is both a lexicon for searching and looking up, or can be read from start to finish, online, on a smartphone, or offline as a pdf or epub; with a screen reader, the epub serves as an audio book.  DisDict is bilingual (German/English), free, open source and extensible.  DisDict is not yet complete, but it is already useful.

We hope that DisDict will help to reduce the widespread narratives of 
Russian propaganda about the war against Ukraine and thus contribute 
to a more resilient society and security in Europe.
