To hide its acts of terror and the killing of civilians, Russia claims that it is the Ukrainian army that is destroying the civilian population. One glaring instance of Russia deflecting blame onto Ukraine involves the heinous acts committed by Russian soldiers in Bucha. On April 3, the Russian Ministry of Defense published a statement,[^denial-bucha-1] later republished by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs,[^denial-bucha-2] that claimed unequivocally that “*the photos and video footage from Bucha are another hoax, a staged production and provocation by the Kiev regime for the Western media,”*[^denial-bucha-3] using the Russian spelling for the Ukrainian capital.
