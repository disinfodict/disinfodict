While Russia prefers a corrupt Ukraine, the Ukrainian people want to get rid of corruption and Ukraine is now a much less corrupt country than Russia

The image of Ukraine as a big country in Europe but with a permanent crisis, corruption problems, and political instability is very common. However, this overlooks major reforms Ukraine has gone through. 

## Independence

The Ukrainian people's decision for independence 1991, see @sec-democracy-ukraine, was also a vote against corruption and in favor of the European Union.


## Orange revolution

The *[Orange Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Revolution)* 2004/2005 was also a vote against corruption and in favor of the European Union.


## Euromaidan

The *[Euromaidan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euromaidan)* 2013/2014 was also a vote against corruption and in favor of the European Union.


## Anti-corruption during war

Ukraine has substantially reduced corruption in spite of the war that Russia started in 2014 and escalated in 2022.

When Viktor Yanukovuch fled from Ukraine in 2014 only approximately $11,000[^corruption-ukraine-1] were left in the treasury. This was a great challenge for the newly established government but didn’t stop reforms.

The National Anti-Corruption Directorate[^corruption-ukraine-2] and the Special Prosecutor's Office against Corruption started their work in 2015, and the High Anti-Corruption Court in 2020\. They are entrusted with uncovering, prosecuting, and sentencing high-ranking political corruption. Newly created organizations were given extensive powers and resources and protected by external political pressure. 

In society, alongside investigative authorities, transparency initiatives that are nearly unparalleled in Europe have emerged. A prime example is ProZorro[^corruption-ukraine-3], the central e-procurement system developed by the public. Furthermore, the mandate for civil servants and their close kin to submit electronic declarations of property has established a level of transparency in Europe that's quite rare, allowing civil society and investigative agencies to scrutinize declared assets.

These reforms and the commitment to combating corruption have laid essential foundations for EU accession prospects.

Despite the war, the OECD recognised the implementation of Ukraine's anti-corruption policy as “high”[^corruption-ukraine-4] in March 2024, and this is producing results: per the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) by Transparency International[^corruption-ukraine-5], Ukraine has seen a gradual yet consistent improvement in its standing on the international stage over recent years, aligning it with other EU aspirants like Serbia, Albania, and Bosnia and Herzegovina[^corruption-ukraine-6].
