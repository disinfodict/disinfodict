# Status {.unnumbered #sec-status-status}

This chapter shows the completion status of all chapters in English and German in percent. Of course, finished chapters can still be corrected and improved. Each subsection without ```lipsum``` placeholder text and ```TODO``` note is considered ready.

Last updated `{r} substr(Sys.time(), 1, 19)`.

```{R}
#| echo: false
load("../status.RData")
pm <- pmax(d[,1],d[,2])
data.frame(status=c(average=mean(pm), completed=sum(pm==100), "not completed"=sum(pm!=100), "TOTAL"=length(pm)))
```

```{R}
#| echo: false
d
```
