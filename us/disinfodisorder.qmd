Disinformation destroys the rule of law and democracy

> What we’re witnessing in America is what happens when disordered discourse captures a political party, then the state itself. The Republican Party was the first to fall - abandoning truth for conspiracy, ideology for grievance, and policy for performative outrage. Now, with its grip on institutions, disordered discourse isn’t just shaping politics - it has overtaken those in power, who now govern as if manufactured narratives were reality, eroding the state and democracy itself from within. Disordered discourse doesn’t just govern through those who believe its manufactured narratives - it forces even those who don’t to submit. To stay in power, they must either bend the knee to the lies or become the next target of the machine they helped create.

## Free speech

On the Munich Security Conference 2025, US Vice-President J.D. Vance attacked Europe allegedly threatening free speech:

> In Britain and across Europe, free speech, I fear, is in retreat. ... sometimes the loudest voices for censorship have come not from within Europe, but from within my own country, where the prior administration threatened and bullied social media companies to censor so-called misinformation ... Now to many of us on the other side of the Atlantic, it looks more and more like old entrenched interests hiding behind ugly Soviet-era words like misinformation and disinformation who simply don’t like the idea that somebody with an alternative viewpoint might express a different opinion or, God forbid, vote a different way or even worse, win an election.[^disinfodisorder-1]

However, there is no threat of free speech in Europe. But in the US. In the month following Trump's inauguration on January 20, 2025, his administration initiated a broad suppression of free expression. This included removing content from federal websites, disciplining media outlets that did not align with the president's rhetoric, and threatening critics of government actions. This approach equates protecting free speech with controlling it, prioritizing government-approved narratives over open discourse.[^disinfodisorder-2]

While the EU, to a minimum extent, tries to dampen the malign influence of disinformation, the US and particularly MAGA insists on free flow of malinformation under the guise of "free speech". Worse, the Trump administration tries to export (Dis)Information Disorder and tries to restrict the freedom of the EU to properly regulate disinformation and hate in Sillycon Valley social networks.[^disinfodisorder-3]



## Free Press

The US, and MAGA in particular, is creating chaos with regard to “free speech” and “free press”: they extend the individual protection to speak freely without fearing consequences (“free speech”) to the right of any useful idiot or foreign propagandist to publish lies to huge audience under the guise of “free press” while simultaneously restricting the freedom of professional journalists, even though they are bound by ethical professional standards. 

The U.S. Constitution addresses the free press in the First Amendment, ratified in 1791 as part of the Bill of Rights. The relevant text states: "Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press." This concise clause prohibits the federal government from enacting laws that restrict the press's ability to publish and disseminate information, ideas, and opinions. Journalistic standards like those from the Society of Professional Journalists encourage accuracy, verification, and fairness, but these are voluntary and not legally binding. 

The European Union, by contrast, does distinguish between "freedom of expression" and "freedom of the press" in its legal framework, though the two are closely linked. The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (adopted in 2000) addresses them in Article 11: Paragraph 1 guarantees "freedom of expression" for everyone, encompassing the right to hold opinions and share information without interference, while Paragraph 2 specifically protects "freedom and pluralism of the media," emphasizing the press’s role in democracy and its institutional independence. This distinction reflects the EU’s focus on safeguarding media diversity and preventing monopolies or state control, alongside individual speech rights. The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), enforced by the European Court of Human Rights, similarly protects "freedom of expression" under Article 10 but often interprets press freedom as a heightened duty due to its public watchdog function (e.g., Sunday Times v. UK, 1979). Unlike the U.S., where obligations are minimal and liability-driven, the EU’s approach blends freedom with a patchwork of national rules and EU-wide rules (2022 Digital Services Act).

The Trump administration excluded the free press - namely AP and Reuters — from the White House press pool[^disinfodisorder-4] and tried to shutdown Radio Free Europe (RFE) and Radio Liberty (RL).[^disinfodisorder-5]:  


## Free Radio

Radio Free Europe (RFE) and Radio Liberty (RL), merged as RFE/RL in 1976, have been vital tools for the United States since their inception during the Cold War. Established to counter Soviet propaganda, they provided uncensored news and information to millions in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, and later other regions like Central Asia and the Middle East where free press was suppressed. By broadcasting in local languages, RFE/RL empowered dissidents, exposed regime abuses, and fostered resistance, significantly contributing to the collapse of communist regimes. For the U.S., they served as a soft power instrument, promoting democratic values and countering authoritarian narratives, thus enhancing national security and global influence.

The attempt to shut down RFE/RL in March 2025, initiated by the Trump administration through funding cuts by the U.S. Agency for Global Media, reflects a shortsighted cost-cutting move, influenced by figures like Elon Musk who criticized it as wasteful. This effort, halted by a federal judge on March 26, 2025, risked abandoning a proven asset at a time when disinformation from adversaries like Russia and China is rampant. Critics argue it would weaken U.S. credibility and cede the information space to hostile powers, a view supported by RFE/RL’s ongoing relevance in reaching 47 million people weekly. The judicial block suggests a recognition of its statutory role and public value, though the underlying debate over its funding reveals tensions between fiscal priorities and strategic interests.


## Free Science

The MAGA movement has grown through disinformation and is therefore waging a cultural war against any attempt to name and sanction disinformation as such. This leads to serious damage for the US and absurdly comical ones. It seems that DOGE is acting against Truth and Science as such. [^disinfodisorder-21] [^disinfodisorder-30] [^disinfodisorder-31] [^disinfodisorder-22] [^disinfodisorder-23] 

The USA was the only country in the United Nations to vote against UN Resolution A/79/L.54, which proposed an “International Day of Hope”.

> The discussion of misinformation and disinformation in OP 9 is an unequivocal redline for the United States. These terms are intentionally nebulous and ill-defined so that they can be wielded as tools of censorship ... Another concern we have about this text is its recalling and reframing of Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).[^disinfodisorder-32]

![Results of UN Resolution on "International Day of Hope"](InternationalDayOfHope.jpeg)


All this suggestes, that the US is suffering from a severe episode of (Dis)Information-Disorder. 


## Disordered Discourse

The term "Information Disorder" finds early conceptual roots in psychological studies of "disordered discourse", particularly linked to schizophrenia. Research published in 2014 explored how schizophrenic individuals exhibit fragmented communication patterns, often termed "disordered discourse," where coherence breaks down due to cognitive disruptions. This study suggested that such patterns reflect an overload or misprocessing of information, a precursor to broader discussions of Information Disorder. Schizophrenia, characterized by delusions and disorganized thinking, provided a clinical lens through which researchers began to frame information processing failures. While not explicitly labeled "Information Disorder" in this context, the parallels—confusion, mistrust, and inability to filter reality—laid groundwork for its later expansion into a societal and cognitive framework:

> Building a mental structure also involves at least two general cognitive mechanisms: enhancement of relevant activation and suppression of irrelevant or inappropriate activation. We suggest that schizophrenics who exhibit verbose disordered discourse have inefficient suppression mechanisms, are impaired in laying a foundation, and tend to shift too often.[^disinfodisorder-8]


## Cognitive Immunology

"Cognitive immunology" is an emerging interdisciplinary field studying how mental processes in healthy individuals resist or succumb to misinformation.[^2] Drawing from psychology and neuroscience, it posits that the mind has "immune-like" mechanisms—such as critical thinking and source evaluation—that protect against false narratives. Research highlights that these defenses, while effective, can also overreact, leading to the dismissal of valid information when it conflicts with pre-existing beliefs.[^disinfodisorder-10] [^disinfodisorder-11] 

So far this science is still nascent with limited empirical consensus. The website [https://cognitiveimmunology.net](https://cognitiveimmunology.net) tracks progress. The  [Mental Immunity Project](https://mentalimmunityproject.org) provides learning and teaching materials. 


## Double Bind

Gregory Bateson’s "Double Bind" theory, developed in the 1950s, describes a communication dilemma where conflicting messages trap individuals in no-win situations, severely impacting mental health, particularly if the sender has power over the receiver such that the receiver must try to fulfill the conflicting messages. For schizophrenic individuals, this dynamic—such as a parent demanding affection while rejecting it—exacerbates confusion and withdrawal, potentially triggering psychotic breaks. In mentally healthy people, repeated exposure to double binds (e.g., societal expectations clashing with reality) fosters anxiety, distrust, and cognitive exhaustion. Bateson argued that such contradictions, when inescapable, erode rational processing, a concept later tied to Information Disorder’s mental toll. The theory underscores how paradoxical messaging—prevalent in modern media—destabilizes both vulnerable and stable minds.[^disinfodisorder-12] 


## Information Disorder

"Information Disorder", as a societal issue, describes the rampant spread of misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation, undermining trust and civic cohesion.[^disinfodisorder-9] It gained prominence in the digital age, with roots in the 2010s when social media amplified fragmented narratives. Key drivers include the decline of traditional journalism, algorithmic bias, and geopolitical tensions. Claire Wardle frames it as a crisis of epistemology, where distinguishing truth becomes nearly impossible. Fuelled by technological advances and eroded gatekeeping, it has evolved into a "disorder" threatening democratic stability, with research highlighting its acceleration during events like the 2016 (and obviously 2024) U.S. election. [^disinfodisorder-13] [^disinfodisorder-14] [^disinfodisorder-15]

> Information disorder is a crisis that exacerbates all other crises. When bad information becomes as prevalent, persuasive, and persistent as good information, it creates a chain reaction of harm ... It undermines democracy.[^disinfodisorder-16]


## Affected Countries 

(Dis)Information Disorder is a worldwide problem, but particularly in countries with high internet penetration and polarized societies—such as the United States, Brazil, India, and the Philippines—have been notably afflicted since the mid-2010s. The U.S. saw a surge post-2016, tied to election interference; Brazil faced similar issues during its 2018 election; India grapples with WhatsApp-driven rumors since 2017; and the Philippines has battled disinformation campaigns since Duterte’s 2016 rise. These nations, marked by rapid digital adoption and political division, became fertile ground for Information Disorder.

> Demokratien wurden nicht dafür geschaffen. Sie sind auf eine gemeinsame, wenn auch umstrittene Realität angewiesen, um zu funktionieren. Wenn das Regieren zu einem Kampf zwischen konkurrierenden Fiktionen wird und nicht zwischen Politik und Wahrheit, werden Institutionen, die für Debatten und Kompromisse gedacht sind, zu Instrumenten zur Durchsetzung von Narrativen. Das Endergebnis ist das, was wir in den USA sehen - eine Demokratie, die um ihr Funktionieren kämpft, weil ihre Institutionen in einem Gestörten Diskurs gefangen sind. Beim Regieren geht es nicht um die Lösung von Problemen, sondern darum, Loyalität gegenüber fabrizierten Narrativen zu demonstrieren. Wenn Sie glauben, dass dies außerhalb der USA nicht passieren kann, sollten Sie bedenken, dass wir alle den gleichen Kräften ausgesetzt sind - dem von den sozialen Medien gesteuerten Diskurs, dem schwindenden Vertrauen in die Institutionen und dem Aufkommen von Erzählungen, die sich von der Realität abkoppeln. Das ist eine systemische Schwachstelle in jeder Demokratie. Wir müssen darüber nachdenken, was dies für unsere Demokratien auf der grundlegendsten Ebene bedeutet. Wie können Institutionen überleben, wenn die Regierungsführung durch engagierte Narrative und nicht durch die Realität bestimmt wird? Wenn die Wahrheit für die Macht irrelevant ist, was hält dann einen Gestörten Diskurs davon ab, den Staat überall zu erobern?

## Akteure und Motive

Die Akteure, die Informationsstörungen verursachen, reichen von staatlich geförderten Gruppen bis hin zu einzelnen Akteuren. Untersuchungen von osf.io zeigen, dass Russland, [^disinfodisorder-17] China und der Iran die Hauptakteure sind, die Desinformationen einsetzen, um Rivalen zu destabilisieren oder die öffentliche Meinung zu beeinflussen, um geopolitische Vorteile zu erzielen. Inländische Akteure, darunter politische Agenten und profitorientierte Inhaltsersteller, verstärken spaltende Darstellungen, um Macht oder Einnahmen zu erzielen. Die Motive sind unterschiedlich: Staaten versuchen, Einfluss zu nehmen, Extremisten wollen radikalisieren, und Betrüger nutzen Klicks aus. Aktuelle Diskussionen auf X deuten auch auf koordinierte Bemühungen von Bots und Troll-Farmen hin, obwohl dies aufgrund der mangelnden Transparenz der X-Algorithmen schwer zu beweisen ist.


## Fighting (Dis)Info Disorder

Measures against (Dis)Information Disorder are suggested, but remarks like "Psycho-social counseling may be necessary for every individual who is suffering from information disorder syndrome" prove that those measures don't scale to the size of the problem.[^disinfodisorder-18] 

Measures like "increasing media literacy" are definitely needed, but fail to help in the short or medium term. This is too slow.  Waiting for scientific evidence before acting is even slower:[^disinfodisorder-22] [^disinfodisorder-23]

> Research is a generational task with uncertain outcomes[^disinfodisorder-19]

Even adults with media literacy today are susceptible to fall for the devastating incentive structure of social networks:

> The biggest lie of all, which this crisis thrives on, and which the beneficiaries of mis- and disinformation feed on, is that the crisis itself is uncontainable ... In reality, merely elevating truthful content is not nearly enough to change our current course. There is an incentive system in
place that manufactures information disorder ... If we want to reduce information disorder, there are structural changes that we can and must make to our information ecosystem, and there are rules that we can and must implement to better govern the decisions and behavior of information platforms and propagators. [^disinfodisorder-16]

The small scale scope of the Information Disorder Prize Competition of the Aspen Institute[^disinfodisorder-20] proves one thing: that the US failed to implement the obviously neccessary regulations of social networks and penalizing lies of malicious actors in those networks. 


## Lost fight in U.S.

The re-election of the conviced criminal Donald Trump in November 2024 is strong evidence that the U.S. democracy lost the fight against (Dis)Information Disorder. Trump was re-elected although he was known to be a liar from his first presidency,[^disinfodisorder-28], although everybody knew he had tried overthrow the government with the Capitol insurrection on Jan 6[^disinfodisorder-6] [^disinfodisorder-7] and although MAGA had anounced with "project 2025" a detailed plan to dismantle the state and democracy:

> Our goal is to assemble an army of aligned, vetted, trained, and prepared conservatives to go to work on Day One to deconstruct the Administrative State.[^disinfodisorder-24]

The Heritage Fondation, who is behind Project 2025, was so kind to compile a list of more than 30 individuals that need to go to jail because of their participation in dismantling democracy.[^disinfodisorder-25] 

Trump was even elected, although he - three times - promised that once he is elected, this would have been the last election in the US:

> Christians, get out and vote! Just this time – you won’t have to do it any more.  
>   
> You know what? It’ll be fixed! It’ll be fine. You won’t have to vote any more, my beautiful Christians.
>  
> I love you. Get out – you gotta get out and vote. In four years, you don’t have to vote again. We’ll have it fixed so good, you’re not gonna have to vote.[^disinfodisorder-26] 

The website [democracy2025.org](https://www.democracy2025.org) tracks attempts to stop or slow down Project 2025.


## National Science Foundation (NSF)

On April 18th, Trump's new Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) informed the public that ongoing grants researching misinformation/disinformation were terminated:

> Hundreds of grants, fellowships, and awards were terminated because they are no longer “aligned with NSF priorities” ... including but not limited to those on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and misinformation/disinformation.”[^disinfodisorder-32]

Under the Trump administration, science in the US is no longer free, and the National Science Foundation (NSF) is no longer to fund research on misinformation/disinformation

> NSF will not support research with the goal of combating "misinformation," "disinformation," and "malinformation" that could be used to infringe on the constitutionally protected speech rights of American citizens across the United States in a manner that **advances a preferred narrative** about significant matters of public debate.[^disinfodisorder-33] [^disinfodisorder-34]

In other words: the NSF must no longer prefer truth over lies. This is a coordinated effort of the White House against the truth. For example the Disinfo Dictionary received a termination notice about its funding US Embassy TechCamp funding on Feb. 27 2025.

## Wikipedia

Nothing represents democratic access to the truth as much as Wikipedia. Hence MAGA, Donald Trump, Elon Musk and Vladimir Putin hate Wikipedia. Hence Musk tried to destroy Wikipedia by buying it (like he did with twitter):

> Wikipedia is certainly not immune to bad information, disagreement, or political warfare, but its openness and transparency rules have made it a remarkably reliable platform in a decidedly unreliable age ... If anything, the site, which is operated by a nonprofit and maintained by volunteers, has become more of a refuge in a fractured online landscape than an ideological prison—a “last bastion of shared reality,” as the writer Alexis Madrigal once called it. And that seems to be precisely why it’s under attack.[^disinfodisorder-35]

Now the Trump administration tries to destroy Wikipedia by destroying its financial support: taking their non-profit status. [^disinfodisorder-36-en] [^disinfodisorder-36-de] 


## Double Bind in the Oval Office

The Oval Office meeting involving Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, U.S. President Donald Trump, and Vice President J.D. Vance exemplifies a "Double Bind." Trump and Vance pressed Zelenskyy to align with U.S. interests while simultaneously questioning Ukraine’s reliability—creating a no-win scenario, see @sec-us-ovaloffice. Zelenskyy faced a bind: concede and lose autonomy or resist and risk aid cuts. This mirrors Bateson’s theory, where contradictory demands (support us, but we doubt you) foster confusion and weaken resolve, amplifying Information Disorder’s political impact.


## Russia in the Oval Office

For disinformation experts familiar with russian active measures it does not come as a surprise that Trump is alligning with Putin:[^disinfodisorder-27] 

> - Trump has been pro-Russia since the 70s, and his sons said that they made a lot of money from Russia  
> - Russians helped Trump win the presidency in 2016  
> - Trump sucked up to Putin already back in 2018, and even gave classified information to Lavrov  
> - Trump despises Zelenskyy because he didn't provide any dirt on the Bidens about the Burisma case in 2019  
> - Trump lifted sanctions against Russian oligarchs and wanted to invite Russia back to G7 in 2019  
> - Trump stalled 400 million aid and Javelin sales to Ukraine  
> - Trump and Mike Johnson stalled Ukraine aid for 7 months in congress  
> - Trump administration is full of pro-Kremlin actors who have blamed NATO and Ukraine for the war. These include Tulsi Gabbard, RFK Jr. and JD Vance  
> - Trump has never criticized Putin yet he called Zelenskyy a 'dictator'
