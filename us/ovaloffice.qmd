::: {.callout-tip title="Truth"}
The democratic leader Zelenskyy of a country suffering war and genocide, was disrespectfully harassed by Donald Trump and J.D. Vance and bravely refused to sign a contract with which American oligarchs wanting to seize Ukrainian raw materials without offering protection.[^us-ovaloffice-1]
:::

Let's start with two quotes:

> I believe what we saw earlier today in the Oval Office was the single most shameful moment in American history. There have of course been other shameful moments. We have betrayed our allies before. But never before have we done it while bullying and humiliating them in front of the entire world because we thought it would make “good television.”[^us-ovaloffice-9]

> The signatories wrote: “The prosecutors and judges appointed by the all-powerful communist political police also told us that they held all the trump cards, while we had none. At the time, they were accused of ingratitude and held responsible for the suffering of thousands of innocent people. “We are shocked that you treated President Volodymyr Zelensky in a similar way."[^us-ovaloffice-11]

During the US election campaign, Trump had loudly promised the American people that he would end the Russian war in Ukraine in 24 hours. In fact, neither Putin wants to end the war unless he is forced to do so by force of arms, and Trump has never made a serious attempt to force Putin to give in. Instead, Trump has probably agreed with Putin to divide up Ukraine, even though he is breaking the Budapest Memorandum. Now Trump needed someone to blame for breaking his promise: Zelenskyy.

[![Zelensky - with suit before and after 3 years of war against his people](Zelensky_before_after.jpeg){width=50%}](https://x.com/AlexBondODUA/status/1897541278285332563)


## Pretext Blackmail

Donald Trump had asked Zelenskyy to sign a contract that gives Ukrainian rare-earths to the US, supposedly to pay back $500 Billion in US aid, and without any quid pro quo in the future. Problem:[^us-ovaloffice-7] [^us-ovaloffice-8]

* that money was not all loan
* nor was it 500 Billion
* it was 120 Billion 
* it was not all money
* because Ukraine received obsolete, 40-year-old weapons that were priced at the new price
* and US taxpayers' money flowed into the US arms industry to develop brand new weapons for the USA

After not immediately signing this blackmail document, Trump called Zelenskyy a dictator, blamed him to have started Russia's war and voted with Russia and North-Korea in the UN against a resolution, that asks Russia to redraw its troops from Ukrainian soil. 


## Planned humiliation?

> **One day earlier**, Zelenskyy’s Oval Office ambush was predicted by State Duma member Oleg Morozov on 60 Minutes, a state TV show. **Morozov said that the meeting would be a lesson in humiliation**, designed to condition Zelenskyy to capitulate to the United States—and later to Russia ... “But first, Daddy will flog him.” ... Popov pointed out that Trump is strangling America’s friends and allies. Tretyakov noted, “He is pursuing policies that are beneficial for Russia.” He surmised, “With respect to Ukraine, he is ready to give Russia everything it wants to take.” ... Russian experts and pundits repeatedly articulated that Moscow isn’t seeking peace but instead wants to conquer as much of Ukraine as possible.[^us-ovaloffice-2] 


## Welcome with Mockery

The mockery of President Zelenskyy, who defends his country for three years against a full-scale genocidal war, begins with the greeting by President Trump himself, pointing to Zelenskyy with his index finger and speaking of him in the third person to the press: "Oh look. He’s all dressed up today!".[^us-ovaloffice-0]

## Five Failures in the Oval Office

Renowned historian Timoy Snyder analyzed five failures in the oval office:[^us-ovaloffice-4]

### Hospitality failure

Yelling and interrupting is unpolite to someone who takes the effort to travel to you.

### Decency failure

Yell at a Ukrainian, who is under attack of war, terror, war-crimes and genocide, not knowing their reality, not knowing the diffucult decisions Ukraininans have to 

### Democracy failure

Zelenskyy is a demoratically elected leader of the Ukrainian people, he represents them with dignity. "If you are a deomcratic person you respect that"

### Strategy failure

Russia is the aggressor, an enemy of the US, specializing in subvertizing US infrastructue and stealing US technlogy, why trow decade-long European allies over for Russia?

### Independence failure

All that has been said by Trump and Vance had before said by Russia. From the US president we shoud expect, to represent US interestes independently from Russia's interests.


## Twenty failures in the Oval Office

We evaluated the complete 50 minute recording and find much more worse failures (excerpts, not a full transcript).[^us-ovaloffice-1] 

::: {.callout-tip title="Summary"}
Zelenskyy is facing a narcissistic President of the US who did not do anything to stop Putin or think about security for Ukraine. His *only* interest was getting a deal on rare earths ... and having Vance blaming Zelenskyy for his Trumps failure to stop Putin.
:::


### Humanity failure

[(0:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEOv4x_FIsc)

Trump treated Zelenskyy the first three minutes completely as an object, as stage decoration for his monologue to the camera about the “deal” and supposedly good talks with Putin, and about how the war would never have started under him. The complete session he contionues speaking to the camera and is not turning to Zelenskyy.


### Empathy failure

[(4:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEOv4x_FIsc&t=240s)

When Zelenskyy *thanks* Trump and explains him, that he hopes that the contract will contain security guarantees, Trump raises his eyebrow disapprovingly, right after the moment when Zelenskyy said “but for us it's very important, you know, to save our country, our relatives, our freedom and democracy”. Zelenskyy continues and offers Trump technology exchange from Ukrainian Drone experience, and talks about abducted children and prisoners of war. Trump stares stiff and impassive at the before-and-after pictures of Ukrainian prisoners of war who look like concentration camp inmates. Not a word of sympathy from Trump, but a direct switch to press questions. 


### Financial failure

[(7:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEOv4x_FIsc&t=465s)

Trump hints that the money he has promised Zelenskyj is essentially only the revenues from rare earths, in other words Ukrainian money of which he is gonna steal 50% for nothing in return.

Journalist: How much money do you put in the fund and how does that create security for Ukraine?  

Trump: "We put some, we don't know how much" 

But Trump rembers very well that this is about rare earths that he wants and talks enthusiastically about what he will do with those rare earths, that belong to Ukraine.


### Security failure

[(9:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEOv4x_FIsc&t=540s)

Journalist: inquired once more about long-term safety 

Trump: "I think once we make the agreement, that's gonna be 95% of it. ... I spoke to President Putin ... I feel very strongly that they are very serious about it. ... Let me make the deal first. I have to make the deal first. I don't worry about security right now. We have to have a deal." 

Then Trump distract with the number of dead soldiers, but quickly comes back to money, and blames Biden for giving money **without security on the money** and focuses on "the american taxpayer money has to be protected". then Trump talks about "weaponry", but not weaponery for Ukraine, but "weaponry" that the US needs and can producte with rare earths.


### Praising the cesar

[(11:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEOv4x_FIsc&t=660s)

  This segment begins with Zelenskyy talking about the importance of LNG terminals and gas storage. Trump jokes without giving an answer, leaving it to the next journalist to ask a question, which turns into a journalistic praise of Trump, who then delivers a narcissistic monologue about how he's the greatest president ever.

[(12:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEOv4x_FIsc&t=720s)


### Failure to help

[(14:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEOv4x_FIsc&t=720s)

Journalist, to Trump, will you continue to send military aid to Ukraine, to Zelenskyy, do you feel that the US is on your side, that President Trump is on your side? Zelenskyy hands over to Trump. Trump, who has already cut USAID, jokes but doesn't confirm he's an ally. Now it's Zelenskyy's turn to say something. 


### Ceasefire failure

[(15:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEOv4x_FIsc&t=900s)

Zelenskyy: "The most important question: Can President Trump I hope yes, with some other allies, to stop Putin, withdraw these enemies from our Land ... I think that if President, or when he will stop Putin, if President Trump will bring peace to our country, I think he will be on this wall" (between paintings of other famous presidents)

Trump: "We had very very good talks"

In other words, Trump has achieved nothing concrete in terms of a ceasefire, a withdrawal of troops, let alone peace.


### Support failure

[(15:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEOv4x_FIsc&t=950s)

Journalist asks about compromises that Zelenskyy would have to make. 

Trump says that he will not support Ukraine, that he sees himself as a neural mediator between to - equally guilty - hostile parties. But in fact he sides with Putin, who is the aggressort in this war, and asks Zelenskyy for concessions.

Trump: "I think you gonna always have to make compromises ... that's all we can do ... I am here as a mediator" 

Then Trump deflects with dead bodies to suddenly become “great farmland, but very little protection against the bullets ... all I can do is see that I get everybody to the table": imperialist greed for valuable Ukrainian land shines through here.



### Praising the peacemaker

[(17:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEOv4x_FIsc&t=1030s)

Journalist praises Trump for “peacemaking”.

Trump: “I hope I will be remembered as a peacemaker” and continues with narcissistic talk about World War III and his winning elections.


### Mock outfit

[(18:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEOv4x_FIsc&t=1030s)

Hostile journalist mocks Zelenskyy: “Do you, why don't you wear a suit [loud laughter in the room] ... do you own a suit?”

Zelenskyy: “... thank you”


### Arms failure

[(19:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEOv4x_FIsc&t=1030s)

Trump lets it  slip that he doesn't plan to send more weapons to Ukraine.

Journalist: "Are you going to send more arms to Ukraine?"

Trump: ".. Hopefully I wan't have to send very much, ... we are not looking forward to sending alot of arms, we are looking forward to getting the war finished, and we can, ah,  do other things, but, äh, we very much appreciate the agreement, because we needed what they had, ..." 

Trump said disrespectfully "they" while "their" President Zelenskyy was sitting next to him. 


### Peace failure

[(20:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEOv4x_FIsc&t=1200s)

Journalist: asks again for security

Trump: "I don't wanna talk about security yet, because I want to get the deal done ... security is so easy, that's about 2% of the problem, I am not worried about security, I worry about to get the deal done ..."

Zelenskyy: "... We can't just speak about ceasefire, ans speak and speak, ... Putin broken 25 times, he broken his onwn signature, 25 times he broke his ceasefire"

Trump: "but he never broke to me"

Zelenskyy: "no, no, you were the president, ... ceasefire will not work without security guarantees ...  Putin today is using ballistic, on our hospital, schools, etc., balistic! So he knows, that we are here, and that President Trump has good will to stop this war ..." 

Zelenskyj patiently explains the important role of the USA and the problem with Putin and patiently explains the ongoing genocide in Ukraine. He praises the document and politely explains that perhaps only 2% is really missing, but that in its current form this is not enough to stop Putin. 

Journalist: I wanted to know, if you provision yourself in the middle between Russia and Ukraine or on the Ukrainian side

Trump: "I am in the middle"

Journalist: are you commited to the eastern flank of NATO

Trump: "I am committed to Poland"

Journalist: are you committed to the Baltics

Trump hesitates, then says that he is also commited to the Baltics (little credible)

Trump: "We made a deal. I am a business person ... " (not a president tackling presidential challenges) "... I think I stopped it ..." an outright lie, while balistic missiles are raining down on Ukraine. 


### Odesa failure

[(32:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEOv4x_FIsc&t=1950s)

Journalist: "Mr. President, would you be willing to visit Ukraine, maybe Odesa?"

Trump: "I don't walk to talk about Odesa, let's not talk about Odesa, I wanna talk about making a deal, getting peace" continues to talk about destroyed Ukrainian cities, Zelenskyy interrupts to explain that not all of Ukraine is destroyed, still needs protection, then Trump continues: talking about Putin's suffering!

Refusing to visit Ukraine, not wanting to talk about Odesa and addressing Putin's "suffering", Trump signals that he would be giving Odesa to Putin - and all the strategic advantage of cutting Ukraine from the sea and conquering first Moldovia, and then the rest of Europe.


### Negotiation failure

[(33:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEOv4x_FIsc&t=2020s)

Journalist: "Mr. President, when did you last speak with President Putin, and what did he say that"

Trump "couple of days ago"

Journalist: "and what did he tell you, that gave you the assurance that he wanted peace?"

Trump evades and deflects: "that's what I do, my whole life is deals, I know good, uh, and I really, I, uh, I've known him for a long time, I've dealt with him for a long time, he had to suffer, uh, through the, uh, Russia hoax, you know, Russia, Russia it was a hoax, it was all Biden, it was nothing to do with him, so he had to suffer through, and he, he was able to do that, uh, I think that uh, he wants to make a deal, and he like to see it end. that's all", and continues narcissistic talk.

Trump has nothing from Putin, stresses that he knows him very long (sounds like longer than his presidencies). Trump makes Biden responsible for the war, and turns Putin into a suffering victim, who would be eager for a peace deal.


### Rule of law failure

[(34:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEOv4x_FIsc&t=2020s)

Journalist asks about free speech, censorship and arresting people for memes in their ex-ally GB (and Europe, now we are in the middle of *Disinformnation Disorder*, there is no censorship neither in GB nor in the EU).

Trump: "they took it too far", then asks "Marco", and Rubio and Vance lie about shared values and explain that they want enforce the corrosive MAGA idea of free speech in Europe, that they insist on exporting *Disinformation Disorder* via their social networks to Europe, which they obviously see as a colony which must not have its own jurisdiction, see @sec-us-disinfodisorder.

Vance: "we fight for free speech of American citizens in Europe"

That is *exactly* Putin's argument of "liberating" russian speakers in Ukraine by bombing them.


### Colonial vibrations

[(36:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEOv4x_FIsc&t=2190s)

Journalist asks for Oil and Gas regarding the deal.

Trump misunderstands the questioner and talks about oil and gas in Ukraine's possession, saying there is not much, the USA has enough.

Journalist clarifies: "Is there any agreement from Ukraine to purchase american LNG" (this would force Ukraine to hand over an even higher proportion of its rare earth revenues to the USA)

Trump: "No, we don't need that"


### Sincerity failure

[(36:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEOv4x_FIsc&t=2215s)

Journalist: asks again about the latest call with Putin.

Trump: "Are you serious with that one? It went well. I think, I think we are going to have a deal on the minerals"


### Protection failure

[(37:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEOv4x_FIsc&t=2230s)

"Mr. President, some of the minerals are in eat Ukraine, not far from the front lines and in areas that Russia has occupied, will you draw President Putin to drawhis forces from these areas?"

Trump: "It's a lot of area, uh, ..."

Journalist: "Would you protect that minerals, if they are US interest?"

Trump: "No, the agree will protect them" and distracts making jokes about CNN not surviving.


### Alignment failure

[(38:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEOv4x_FIsc&t=2290s)

Journalist: "My friends in Poland ... are worried that you align yourself too much with Putin. What's your message for them?"

(From here a complete transcript from Forbes[^us-ovaloffice-5])

Trump justifies aligning himself with Putin: "Well, if I didn't align myself with both of them, you'd never have a deal ...  I'm not aligned with anybody. I'm aligned with the United States of America, and for the good of the world, I'm aligned with the world, and I want to get this thing over with. You see, the hatred he's got for Putin that's very tough for me to make a deal with that kind of hate". 


### Pro-russian attack

[(39:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEOv4x_FIsc&t=2385s)

Vance jumps in and inaccurately claims that Biden talked tough to Putin (in fact, Biden encouraged Putin to attack by unnecessarily stating that he was ruling out American troops on the ground). Vance repeats the Russian narrative that more diplomacy with Russia is needed.

Zelensky makes the last attempt to explain the situation, that Putin invaded despite diplomacy and broke all treaties (and he refrains from referring to the broken promises of the USA in the Budapest Memorandum).

Vance respeclessly say "with due respect" and attacks Zelenskyy repeating the russian narrative, about Ukraine being evil by forcing conscripts to the frontline. 

Zelenskyy: "Have you ever been to Ukraine that you see what problems we have?"

Vance lies: "I have been to—"

Zelenskyy: "Come once."

Vance continues to attack Zelenskyj (nine long minutes remain). 

Vance with perpetrator-victim reversal: "And do you think that it’s respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?"

Zelenskyy: "A lot of questions. Let’s start from the beginning."

Vance: "Sure"

Zelenskyy: "First of all, during the war, everybody has problems. Even you, but you have nice ocean and don’t feel now, but you’ll feel it in the future. God bless, god bless"

Zelenskyy is interrupted and attacked by both, Trump and Vance. 

Trump with perpetrator-victim reversal: "You’re right now not in a very good position. You’ve allowed yourself to be in a very bad position and he happens to be right about it ...  you’re gambling with the lives of millions of people. You’re gambling with World War III. "

Vance falsely claims that Zelensky did not thank him and that Zelensky campaigned for the opposition in Pennsylvania (Zelensky visited a weapons factory).

The “dealmaker” Trump tries to pressure Zelenskyj into the deal and invents 350 billion dollars that “we gave you” (he gave nothing and Biden gave much less, and not in cash, but in the form of weapons, some of them older, depreciated to new value).

Trump and Vance try to press Zelenskyy to thank them by signing the document. Zelenskyy resists.

Vance with double-bind "Accept that there are disagreements and let’s go litigate those disagreements rather than trying to fight it out in the American media when you’re wrong. We know that you’re wrong." 

In reality, Trump had the power to determine this framework, which put Zelensky under maximum pressure, both physically in the room and through the Trumpist media, which grilled him in front of the whole world. Zelensky had no way to escape: 

* if he signs, he betrays his people, his nation
* if he doesn't sign, they blame him for continuing a war, that they decided, not to stop.

Trump joins double-bind: "But you see, I think it’s good for the American people to see what’s going on. I think it’s very important, that’s why I kept this going so long. You have to be thankful" (and we define what that is). Pressing Zelenskyy goes on. 

Journalist: "One more question…"

Trump: "It's going to be a tough deal to make. Because attitudes have to change."

Journalist: "What if Russia breaks ceasefire? What if Russia breaks…?"

Trump threatens journalist: "What are you saying?"

Vance: "She’s asking, ‘what if Russia breaks the ceasefire?’"

Trump: "Well what if they—what if anything! What if a bomb drops on your head right now? Okay? What if they broke it? I don’t know. They broke it with Biden because Biden, they didn’t respect him, they didn’t respect Obama. They respect me. Let me tell you, Putin went through a hell of a lot with me. He went through a phony witch hunt where they used him and Russia—Russia, Russia, Russia, you ever hear of that deal? That was a phony—that was a phony Hunter Biden, Joe Biden scam. Hillary Clinton, shifty Adam Schiff, it was a Democrat scam. And he had to go through that. And he did go through it and we didn’t end up in a war. He went through it, he was accused of all that stuff—he had nothing to do with it. It came out of Hunter Biden’s bathroom. It came out of Hunter Biden’s bedroom. It was disgusting. And then they said, ‘Oh, oh, the laptop from hell was made by Russia.’ The 51 agents, the whole thing was a scam, and he had to put up with that. He was being accused of all that stuff. All I can say is this: He might’ve broken deals with Obama, and Bush, and he might’ve broken them with Biden. He did, maybe, maybe he didn’t—I don’t know what happened. But he didn’t break them with me. He wants to make a deal. I don’t know if he can make a deal."

This is manifest Disinformation Disorder, full of lies, violence and siding with Putin.

Trump: But you’re either going to make a deal, or we’re out. And if we’re out, you’ll fight it out. I don’t think it’s going to be pretty, but you’ll fight it out. But you don’t have the cards. But once we sign that deal, you’re in a much better position. But you’re not acting at all thankful, and that’s not a nice thing. I’ll be honest, that’s not a nice thing.

Trumps turns to journalists: "Alright, I think we’ve seen enough, what do you think? This is going to be great television, I will say that."


## Thank you?

Here we quote a tweet of Michael McFaul:[^us-ovaloffice-11]

> Zelenskyy has thanked Trump, Congress, and the American people many times. But let's be clear: when Trump and Vance said that THEY are trying to help Ukraine right now, and need to be thanked for the work personally, there are reasons to wonder.  
>  
>1. Team Trump has told Ukraine that they have to give up territory to Russia. Zelenskyy should thank them for that?  
>2. Trump has told Ukraine that they cannot join NATO. Zelenskyy should thank them for that?  
>3. Team Trump has said that if there is an international peacekeeping force in Ukraine, American soldiers will not participate.  Zelenskyy should thank them for that?  
>4. Team Trump has said that they plan to reduce the number of U.S. soldiers deployed in Europe. That's a huge gift to Putin. Zelenskyy should thank them for that?   
>5. Zelenskyy has been told that Ukraine must hold new presidential elections before negotiations to end the war start.  Zelenskyy should thank them for that?  
>6. U.S.-Russia relations were formally restarted without any preconditions at a meeting between Secretary of State Rubio and Foreign Minister Lavrov in Saudi Arabia.  
>7. Trump officials have hinted at sanctions relief for Russia.  
>8. Trump invited Russia to rejoin the G7.  
>9. The United States voted “No” on a UN resolution condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In doing so, Trump broke ranks with American democratic allies and sided with Russia, Belarus, North Korea, and other dictatorships. Zelenskyy should thank them for that?  
>10. The aid that Vance demanded Zelenskyy thank him for today?  Vance voted against it.  The GOP held it it up for 6 months. Trump said that "stupid"   Biden gave it.  
>   
> So what exactly should Zelenskyy be thanking Trump/Vance for?  Congress, yes. The American taxpayer, yes. But Trump has not done anything for Ukraine yet. All Trump team does is offer gifts to Putin. It's the Russian dictator who they should be demanding thanks from.

## Excuse me?

After Trump had kicked President Zelenskyy out of the White House, he was grilled for more than twenty minutes in an outrageous interview on Trump's Fox news channel. Did he not want to apologize? (For what?) Whether he thought the relationship with Trump could still be mended? (It would have been better to ask Trump.) Whether he shouldn't resign? (So that another less brave president could hand his country over to mafia oligarchs?)


## Final verdict

US-based historian Thomas Zimmer explains that no matter what Zelenskyj would have done, the US would no longer consider Europe an ally, let alone a friend: [^us-ovaloffice-6]

> I think this is completely wrong because it is based on a very fundamental misunderstanding: The idea that Trump's position on this issue can be controlled by tactical skill and diplomatic finesse. This is wishful thinking that continues to cling to the idea that Trump has no consistent position at all. He is perhaps just a businessman who wants to negotiate a good deal and also someone who can somehow be sold anything through flattery.  
>  
> However, this completely ignores the fact that Trump has had a very clear stance on this conflict for many years and a very clear inclination towards Russia and autocratic rulers like Putin. It also completely ignores the fact that the Trumpist forces now in power are pursuing a clear, ideologically defined project in the USA. They are really serious about turning away from the liberal world order, from Europe's liberal democracies. They have something completely different in mind. We have to let go of the idea that with a little skill, with a little tact, we can somehow avert all this.  


## Respectful Meeting

In stark contrast, the following day Zelensky is given a polite, friendly reception in Downing Street, and of course reciprocated with well-deserved thanks:[^us-ovaloffice-10]
