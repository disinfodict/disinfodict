## I will not return Crimea to Kyiv

In 2014 Navalny declared that "Crimea will remain part of Russia and will never become part of Ukraine again in the foreseeable future". He also said that when he becomes president of the Russian Federation, he will not return the semi-island to Kyiv: "Crimea is what, a sandwich with sausage to be returned here and there?"

## 15 theses of a Russian citizen

On February 20th 2023 Navalny's twitter account published [15 theses of a Russian citizen who desires the best for their country](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2023/02/20/navalny-sets-out-15-point-plan-for-russias-postwar-development-a80276) in which Navalny recognized the international borders of Ukraine ... and not outspoken that Crimea belong to Ukraine. An [opinion in The Moscow Times](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2023/03/07/navalnys-policy-shift-on-crimea-may-be-too-little-too-late-a80396) analyzed this as "Too Little, Too Late": 

> The [backlash against Pevchikh’s recent interview](https://x.com/pevchikh/status/1619101058395144193?s=46&t=QQp_KXYrt1M7F76WitO0-g) was perhaps the final straw in making Navalny see he could no longer sit on two chairs. The promise to respect Ukraine’s 1991 borders, and his acknowledgment that there is “nothing to discuss,” is as close as Navalny is likely to come to pledging Crimea’s return to Ukraine.


## Wrong priorities

In July 2023 the first NAFO summit took place in Vilnius a week before the NATO meeting. The [NAFO pro-Ukraine grassroot warriors received the The Star of Lithuanian Diplomacy](https://www.thetimes.com/article/nafo-not-nato-take-the-fight-to-russias-internet-trolls-3c0b0r3k8), one of the highest honours the Baltic state can confer on foreign citizens.

However, instead of celebrating NAFO freedom fighters, Navalny's team distracted with a condemnation of a sideshow: an inflatable plastic shark. Read about this in [The Bulwark](https://www.thebulwark.com/p/russian-opposition-ukrainian-activists-clashing) and in [dailykos](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2023/7/15/2180790/-How-Russian-snowflakes-got-outraged-over-NAFO-s-toy-shark-they-claim-symbolizes-Russophobia). Here is a [report of a NAFO activist](https://jaanus.com/nafo-zakharova/). 

The weird priorities of Team Navalny are best summed up in this post by Kate Levchuk:

Note that [Maria Pevchikh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Pevchikh) studied at the Faculty of Sociology of Moscow State University, where fascist Alexander Dugin was the supervisor of her thesis "Ethno-sociological portrait of modern Great Britain".


## Useless opposition

- Russian opposition can't be trusted
- is supporting russian imperialism
- absolves the Russian people
- calls for an end to sanctions
- misleads the West
- is teethless
- steals support from Ukraine
