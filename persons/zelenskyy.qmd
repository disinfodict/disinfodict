The Jewish President Zelenskyy preferred ammunition to a ride

## Role model for Heroes

When Russia invaded, Zelenskyy acted as a role model for the Ukrainian heroes (see @sec-ukraine-heroes): 

> The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride 
>
> Zelenskyy [^persons-zelenskyy-1]


## Jew, not Nazi

Asked how jewish Zelenskyy is, the *The Jewish Chronicle* wrote:

> All our heroes, even the military heroes, fight not because they want to fight, not because they are aggressive, but because it is the right thing to do. That is a really strong tradition in Judaism 
>
> Lisa Maurice, senior lecturer Bar Ilan University near Tel Aviv[^persons-zelenskyy-2]

## Leadership, not prejudices

Zelenskyy picking Muslim defense minister Umerov debunks Russia’s “Nazi” slurs:

> While Umerov is a strong candidate in his own right, his status as a member of Ukraine’s Muslim Crimean Tatar minority makes his anticipated appointment particularly significant on a symbolic level. Once Umerov is confirmed, Ukraine will have a Jewish President and a Muslim Minister of Defense, underlining the diversity of the country’s leadership while exposing the absurdity of Russia’s “Nazi Ukraine” propaganda.

## No elections during war

The issue of holding elections during the war has recently sparked heated debates and accusations against the Ukrainian government for following autocratic tendencies.

However, according to Ukrainian law, conducting elections amidst martial law is impossible. In particular, Article 83 of the Constitution of Ukraine does not allow parliamentary elections while martial law or a state of emergency is in effect,[^persons-zelenskyy-4] while the Election Code[^persons-zelenskyy-5] and the Law of Ukraine "On the legal status of martial law"[^persons-zelenskyy-6] restrict both local and national elections, including presidential elections.

This regulation echoes also in other countries, including Germany, as enshrined in Article 115h of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany.[^persons-zelenskyy-7]

Unlike in Germany, the Ukrainian parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, can only impose martial law for 30, 60, or 90 days.[^persons-Zelenskyy-8] The Ukrainian president is therefore democratically reconfirmed by parliament at least every 90 days.[^persons-Zelenskyy-9]
