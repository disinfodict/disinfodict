This is the continuation of centuries of unscrupulous expansion of the Russian empire, see @sec-russia-history.

## Dugin

The Russian fascist Dugin is considered the inventor of modern “Eurasianism” [![Link to Wikipedia](../all_common_img/Wikipedia.png){height=1em}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasianism)

> Dugin soon began publishing his own journal entitled Elementy, which initially began by praising Franco-Belgian Jean-François Thiriart, belatedly a supporter of a "Euro-Soviet empire which would stretch from Dublin to Vladivostok and would also need to expand to the south, since it require(s) a port on the Indian Ocean."  
> Alexandr Dugin (1997)[^russia-empire-1]


## Putin

In a speech in Berlin Putin (2010) called for the geopolitical unification of “Greater Europe” from Lisbon to Vladivostok (@Sakwa:2021).

> the creation of a harmonious economic community from Lisbon to Vladivostok. In the future, a free trade zone and **even more advanced forms of economic integration** could also be considered  
> Vladimir Putin (2010)[^russia-empire-2] (our translation, our emphasis)

On June 20, 2025 at the International Economic Forum in St. Petersburg, Putin openly admitted his imperialist goals:

> Russians and Ukrainians are one people ... In this sense, the whole of Ukraine is ours ... Wherever a Russian soldier sets foot is ours."[^russia-empire-6]


## Medvedev

Russia's Deputy Chairman of the Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, April 5th 2022, continues to call the atrocities committed by of Russians in Bucha and Mariupol fake, adding that Russia's goal is to change the minds of Ukrainians and create an "open Eurasia from Lisbon to Vladivostok".[^russia-empire-3]


## Lavrov

Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov wants to "denazify" "more and more European countries": 

> We are not just seeing neo-Nazism, we are seeing direct nazism, which is covering more and more European countries  
> Sergei Lavrov (2023)[^russia-empire-4]


## Sourkov

Vladislav Sourkov explains, what russian imperialism really means: "For Russia, **permanent expansion**
 is not just another idea, it **is the existential condition of our historical existence**": 

> The Russian world has no borders. The Russian world is everywhere there is Russian influence, in one form or another: cultural, informational, military, economic, ideological or humanitarian... In other words, it is everywhere. The extent of our influence varies greatly from region to region, but it is never zero. So we will spread out in all directions, as far as God wills and as strong as we are. The important thing is not to get carried away and not to take on too big a piece.  
> Vladislav Sourkov (2025)[^russia-empire-5]
