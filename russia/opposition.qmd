## Russian opposition can't be trusted

Russia has a tradition of "managed" opposition ...

{{< lipsum 2 >}}


## is supporting russian imperialism

[Most Russians support peace talks but reject return of Crimea](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/12/13/russian-poll-peace-crimea/), and that is more or less the position of russian opposition as well^[We explicitly exclude Garry Kasparov from this statement]. See for example @sec-persons-navalny.


## absolves the Russian people

> There are many people in Russia who are against the war, who don't believe Kremlin propaganda
> [Kara-Murza, February 8 20024](https://www.dw.com/en/prisoner-swap-russian-dissidents-conflicted-over-release/a-69844483)

> It is wrong to associate Russian people with the government's policies
> [Pivovarov, February 8 20024](https://www.dw.com/en/prisoner-swap-russian-dissidents-conflicted-over-release/a-69844483)

In fact is is hundreds of thousands Ordinary Russian Citizens (ORCs), who torture and murder on Ukrainian soil. 


## calls for an end to sanctions

[Kara Murza said, sanctions against Russia would be unfair](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2024/08/3/7468716/)
