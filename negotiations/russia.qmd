Putin and other Russian officials have regularly falsely claimed that the Kremlin is willing to negotiate to end the war, at the same time signaling that the Kremlin maintains its maximalist goals for Ukraine, including territorial claims and a change of government. In a recent interview, Russian President Vladimir Putin said: “*It’s somehow ridiculous on our part to negotiate now just because they’re running out of cartridges”.*[^85] This implies that the Russian government negotiates only if they suffer defeat on the battlefield. This suggests that the Russian government only negotiates when it suffers a defeat on the battlefield. This assessment was also made by the *“Institute for the Study of War”* [^86] in June 2024\. Ukrainian officials, on the other hand, have expressed their readiness to negotiate with Russia as soon as Russia withdraws its troops from the internationally recognized territory of Ukraine, including Donbas and Crimea.
