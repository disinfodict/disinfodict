::: {.callout-tip title="Truth"}
- Russia is killing the culture in its colonies and appropriating the culture of its invaded neighbors.
- The true culture of Russia consists of corruption and lies, violence and fear.

The Ukrainian culture has indeed long been overshadowed by Russian influence and thus overlooked by the international community. While such names as Dostoevsky, Pushkin, and Tchaikovsky are widely known in Western society, prominent Ukrainian figures like Taras Shevchenko, Lesya Ukrainka, or Mykola Leontovych are hardly recognizable in European countries. Moreover, East European studies focus mainly on Russian history, language, and culture, and only the full-scale Russian invasion “catalyzed the long-overdue review of the role and place of Ukrainian studies abroad”, resulting in 160 Ukrainian studies centers in about 30 countries worldwide.[^224]


## Trojan horse

Russia maintains a "Great Russian Culture" as Trojan Horse to expand it empire. One example is the Russian House in Berlin, which spreads Putin propaganda despite EU sanctions.[^17a] 


## Jailing & Killing 

Russa has a long tradition to jail and kill non-russian culture. This creates the illusion that Russia has more culture than Ukraine. 

The Soviet regime suppressed Ukrainian nationalism, leading to the persecution of intellectuals, artists, and political figures who advocated for Ukrainian independence. The peak of these persecutions is known as the Executed Renaissance or Red Renaissance.[^225] This term is used to refer to Ukrainian intellectuals in literature, philosophy, art, music, theater, and cinema of the 1920s and early 1930s who faced arrests, deportations, imprisonment, and execution during the Great Terror of 1937–1938.

This tendency was promoted in the following years, known as the persecution of dissidents.[^226] Many Ukrainian intellectuals were imprisoned, tortured, and killed even in the late decades of Soviet rule, among them are Vasyl Stus, Vasyl Symonenko, and Alla Horska, who have become symbols of anti-Soviet resistance in the post-Stalin periods.

Fortunately, nowadays, no one has any doubts that Joseph Stalin was a brutal and murderous dictator. With Stalin being considered the embodiment of evil, other Soviet rulers often seem to be less repressive and more liberal.

However, Stalin’s successors did not change the general Soviet policy framework, although they followed more subtle and indirect approaches to downplay the role of national languages. In particular, Nikita Khrushchev implemented a strategy to eliminate non-Russian languages from primary and secondary education by enacting a new law granting parents the authority to choose whether their children would attend schools with instruction in Russian or their native language. Designed to appear democratic, this law aimed at further assimilation, as Russian speakers enjoyed benefits in higher education, political and economic institutions, and cultural life. As a result, in 1987, Ukrainian-language schools accounted for only 16% of educational institutions in national and regional capitals, while 12% were mixed (predominantly Russian), and the majority, 72%, were Russian-language schools. Notably, cities such as Chernihiv, Donetsk, Simferopol, and Luhansk had no Ukrainian schools at that time.[^227]

Some prominent examples of persecuted Ukrainians:

- Mykola Dmytrowytsch Leontowytsch, 1877 - 1921, created 150 compositions for choirs. [Leontovych was shot by an agent of the Cheka secret service.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mykola_Leontovych)
- Wassyl Oleksandrowytsch Barwinskyj, 1888 - 1963, was a Ukrainian composer, pianist, music critic, music teacher and conductor. [He was arrested in 1948 and deported with his wife to a prison camp in Mordovia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasyl_Barvinsky) 
- [Vsevolod Petrovich Zaderatsky, 1891 - 1953](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vsevolod_Zaderatsky), was a Ukrainian composer, pianist and teacher. Her created works very similar to the famous russian Dmitri Shostakovich. While Shostakovich became famous, [Zaderatsky rotted away in the gulag](https://www.deutschlandfunkkultur.de/komponist-vsevolod-zaderatsky-100.html) and his [24 Preludes were first performed in 2014](https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/der-russische-komponist-vsevolod-zaderatsky-musik-als-100.html).
- [Valentyn Silvestrov, born in Kyiv in 1937](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentyn_Silvestrov), is a Ukrainian composer. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Silvestrov fled to Berlin with his daughter and granddaughter in March 2022.
- Victoria Amelina, 1986 - 2023, a gifted Ukrainina writer, was killed by the russians. Read her excellent essay on [Cancel culture vs. execute culture](https://www.eurozine.com/cancel-culture-vs-execute-culture/)


## Appropriating

Another technique for making Russian culture appear larger than it is is the appropriation of non-Russian culture: anyone who wants to make a career in the Russian empire must speak Russian and be prepared to see themselves as a Russian cultural creator. Beispiele

## Violent culture

Russia's culture is not only smaller than many believe, it is also a culture of alcohol, learned helplessness, violence, nationalism and even fascism.
