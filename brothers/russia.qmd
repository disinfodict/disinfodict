Putin has claimed, that Russians and Ukrainians are one people.[^brothers-russia-1] 


## Pan-Slavism

In general historical context, the notion of “brotherly nations” has its roots in Pan-Slavism,[^brothers-russia-2] which originated, similar to Pan-Germanism,[^brothers-russia-3] in the aftermath of the French Revolution and the subsequent Napoleonic Wars. Both of these Romantic nationalist movements thrived on the feelings of unity and nationalism that emerged within ethnic groups during this period of upheaval against traditional European monarchies.


## Imperial Russia

In Imperial Russia, this notion transformed into the idea of an *All-Russian nation* or *triune Russian nation (consisting of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus)[^brothers-russia-4]*, the primary goal of which was to deny the existence of Ukrainian and Belarusian identities and to demonstrate the inferiority of these nations compared to Russians. This can be seen even in labeling Ukrainians as “Little Russians.” Later on, in the Soviet Union, this propagandistic idea received a new, less straightforwardly imperialistic form of “brotherly nations,” a notion that did not negate Ukrainians as a separate nation but still served as merely a cover-up for its consistent policy of Russification.


## Wishful thinking

In reality, it is hard to find any plausible arguments that could convincingly back this idea. Since the two nations started to take shape after the fall of Kyivan Rus' (around 1240), they went their separate ways, experiencing different influences and forming different political cultures. Ukrainian national identity finally emerged in the 19th century (which was the case for most European nations),[^brothers-russia-5] when Ukraine was divided between the Russian Empire in the east and the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the west. 


## Soviet Union

Interestingly, the formation of the Soviet Union is often seen solely as a treaty between the Russian, Ukrainian, and Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republics, and the preceding events mostly remain out of the spotlight. However, the Bolsheviks did not receive support in Ukraine, and the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic was forcefully formed as a result of the Ukrainian-Soviet War in 1917–1921.[^brothers-russia-6]


## Red Terror

Finally, taking into account the disasters and tragedies Ukraine experienced throughout the 20th century, it is fair that Ukrainian society perceives Russians as a hostile nation, not only its current political leadership. Almost every Ukrainian family experienced losses not only in the cauldron of World War II but also in great famines, waves of political repressions, and deportations conducted by Russians.

## Russia's war

Thus, naming this war “Putin’s war”, as often witnessed particularly in German media outlets, is rather inaccurate, as the current hostilities are historically speaking just another stage of centuries-long Russian aggression against the Ukrainian people, whether in the form of direct fights or more intricate ways of extermination. So, the history of “brotherly nations” — the idea that 91% of Ukrainians[^brothers-russia-7] do not support nowadays — is instead the history of mass destruction, murder, invasion, deportations, deception, and degradation. Ukrainian-Russian relations are now perceived as less fraternal at the political and social levels compared to the past, exemplified by the Bundestag's recognition of the Holodomor as genocide in Ukraine in November 2022.[^brothers-russia-8]


## Russia's genocide

If Russians and Ukrainians could be considered as one people with a common history and culture to share, the question arises why Russia, as the bigger brother, announced genocide of Ukraine  (@sec-genocide-announced) and deliberately destroys Ukrainian culture  (@sec-warcrimes-culture) and kills Ukrainian people (@sec-warcrimes-civilians)?
