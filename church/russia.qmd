## Persecution under Khrushchev

While the Russian Orthodox Church was brutally persecuted under Stalin, it experienced a revival after his death, albeit under strict control by the KGB and later the FSB. Under Stalin, religious institutions were heavily suppressed, and their members persecuted. [^262]

## Glasnost and KGB

After Stalin's death, the Church was formally recognized again, but the KGB used it to control the population and closely monitored its activities. [^263] This control continued under the FSB, and high-ranking church officials such as Patriarch Kirill had connections with the KGB.[^264] 

## Warmonger Kirill

Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church, while urging the clergy to abandon “flashy and provocative luxury,” possesses multiple million-dollar properties.[^265] Kirill, who was spying for the KGB in Switzerland in the 1970s,[^266] publicly supported Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. His predecessor, Patriarch Alexy II was a KGB agent as well.[^267]
