## What the Bible says

Almost everyone knows the Bible quote “plowshares into swords!” (Micah or Isaiah). The Bible praises the willingness to make peace, which is what the quote stands for, but the Bible is also capable of learning:

> "Make your plowshares into swords and your sickles into spears! Even the weak shall say, 'I am strong!'" (Joel 4:10, Luther Translation)

It is permissible to defend oneself against an armed attacker:  

> In Joel's time, people are happy about 70 years of external peace and sing Hallelujah, quoting the beautiful promises of Isaiah and Micah – but once again, injustice has spread ... In Joel's time, the premonition of a great catastrophe for Israel intensified. And it did come: first through the Assyrians for the northern kingdom, then through the Babylonians for Jerusalem and the southern kingdom.[^peace-weapons-1]
