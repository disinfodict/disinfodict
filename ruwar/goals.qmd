## Maintaining power

It is assumed that Putin used [explosive attacks staged by the FSB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Russian_apartment_bombings) to create a pretext for the second Chechen War: this secured him victory in his first election as a strong leader.[^ruwar-goals-1] Every time Putin has started a war, his approval ratings have risen.[^ruwar-goals-2] For Putin, war is an important instrument for maintaining domestic power.[^ruwar-goals-5] 


## Conquering land

> The Russian world has no borders (Vladislav Sourkov)

Since the founding of Moscow, Russian imperialism has strived for conquest, see @sec-russia-history. The Russian Empire (“Russki Mir”), disguised as “Russian peace,” knows no boundaries in its conquest of the “Russian world,” see  @sec-russia-empire.


## Natural resources

This conquest is not only about land, because of its value, but also about space for renewable energies, because the fossil fuel business is coming to an end, and it is about Ukrainian raw materials, because Ukraine is rich in natural resources.


## Capturing people

Russia needs people it can exploit as slave labor and as cannon fodder for its wars.


## Strategic value

> Eurasia from Lisbon to Dublin (Alexander Dugin)

> Eurasia from Lisbon to Vladivostok (Dmitry Medvedev)

The larger Russia's share of the “Eurasian space” and the smaller the remaining free West of Europe, the easier it will be for Russia to conquer all of Europe. The further Russia expands westward, the more difficult and expensive it will be for a defensive Europe to destroy the weapons factories in eastern Russia. From the front line on the Dnieper, this is still possible, but not if Ukraine falls.


## Fascist Goals

> Russia Wants to Lock Ukraine Back in the Soviet Cellar[^ruwar-goals-3]

Russia has transformed itself into a fascist society and pursues fascist goals, see the chapter on Russian fascism (@sec-nazis-russia).


## Cynicism and Boredom

> When everything is calm, measured, stable, we are bored, this is when everyone wants action (Vladimir Putin)[^ruwar-goals-4]

The Russian DNA was formed in 800 years of conquering kingdom, slavedom, and boredom, see @sec-russia-life, @sec-russia-soul, @sec-russia-values, and @sec-warcrimes-intro.
