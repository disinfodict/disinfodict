## Help is legitimate and legal

Ukraine is a sovereign nation with the right to self-defense, as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter. Providing military assistance to a country facing unprovoked aggression is therefore legitimate under international law.

Western aid has so far helped Ukraine to conduct successful military operations and liberate its territories: Kyiv region, Kharkiv region,[^69] and Kherson.[^70] Each day, it helps repel constant Russian attacks. Western support is crucial in terms of restocking Ukrainian ammunition and protecting Ukrainian civilian infrastructure.

The Ukrainian government has repeatedly stated that it only uses its weapons for self-defense and to repel the Russian attack. Ukraine works with its arms suppliers to ensure that weapons are not misused and that the humanitarian principles of the laws of war are respected.

Russia is also reliant on supplies of arms and components from countries like Iran, North Korea, and China. Unlike the West, these states do not put any conditions. The recently supplied North Korean ballistic missiles have already killed at least 24 Ukrainians and injured more than 70.[^71][^72]

The demand to immediately stop arms exports to Ukraine would favor the aggressor and leave Ukraine in a weak position. There are no comparable calls on Russia and its allies to stop their own arms supplies. An immediate halt to arms deliveries to Ukraine would allow Russia to further build its military superiority and strike again.

## Help is effective

The delayed military support caused more struggle and “slower-than-expected” progress of the Ukrainian army. There is a direct connection between weapons deliveries and the progress of the Ukrainian army, as well as protecting the lives of civilians. For instance, a delay in the delivery of tanks and infantry fighting vehicles by over a year gave Russia time to fortify defenses,[^73] hindering Ukraine's counteroffensive. Ukraine urgently requested Western tanks at the NATO summit on March 24, 2022\. However, the first batch of 31 M1A1 Abrams tanks, equipped with mine plows, arrived a year and a half later on September 25, 2023\. German Leopard tanks arrived a year after initial requests. These delays hampered Ukraine's mine-clearing abilities and slowed advances on the heavily mined frontline.[^74] ATACMS, requested by Ukraine on September 12, 2022, arrived on October 17, 2023, delayed by Western concerns.[^75] Their delay hindered Ukraine's ability to strike deep into Russian-occupied territory. Similarly, F-16s and F-15s, requested in March 2022, were approved after 1.5 years, leaving Ukraine vulnerable[^76] to Russian air superiority.

Historically, the Russian army lost wars to presumably weaker enemies. For instance, the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989 due to the Mujahideen employing guerrilla tactics against the Red Army, the United Nations’ request to leave, and the USA placing economic sanctions.[^77]

 Russia's claim that supplying weapons to Ukraine won't help win is countered by Ukraine's adaptability. 
 
## Russian escalation

The slow arming strategy has emboldened Putin, reinforcing his perception of Western weakness. Despite delays, Ukraine has achieved success, but addressing supply delays is crucial for future operations.

It is Russia who escalates ... unprovoked. 

- Russia invaded ... unprovoked
- Russia abducted children ... unprovoked
- Russia attacked civilians ... unprovoked
- Russia raped and tortured ... unprovoked
- Russia attacked nuclear power stations and destroyed dams ... unprovoked

There are multiple examples of Russia escalating after perceiving Ukraine as weak, after Western hesitation.

## Red lines

There are multiple examples of crossing Russia's "red lines" ... and Russia accepts or even withdraws
