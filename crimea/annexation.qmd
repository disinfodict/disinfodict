## Military invasion

When asked about the people who seized the buildings of the Crimean parliament and installed Russian flags on them on 27 February 2014, Putin replied that those were “local self-defense units.”[^1]

In fact, “the Crimean local defense units” concerned about alleged threats from Ukrainian ultranationalists never existed. 

The film titled “Crimea: The Way Home,” which was aired on Russian state television in March 2015, made clear that the “little green men” who took control of the Crimean government buildings, airports, and other facilities were Russian soldiers.[^2] The Simferopol airport, where Putin’s ambassador to the EU, Vladimir Chizhov, had said there were no Russian troops operating[^3], was taken over by marines from Russia's Black Sea Fleet at Sevastopol[^4].

## Illegal annexation

20 February 2014 as the official date of the beginning of the annexation of Crimea is not even denied by the Russians as it is indicated on the campaign medal “For the Return of Crimea” of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation.[^5]

The then Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych fled Kyiv only on the next day.[^6] And two days after the start of the Russian operation to annex the peninsula, on 22 February 2014, the Ukrainian parliament passed a resolution that established that Yanukovych had removed himself from fulfilling his constitutional duties.[^7]

## Against Crimeans

No organized separatist movement existed in Crimea before its occupation in 2014\. According to the results of the nationwide Ukrainian referendum in 1991, 54.19% of voters in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea voted for the declaration of independence, and 57% in the city of Sevastopol[^8].

A poll by the International Republican Institute in May 2013 found that 53% of the residents of Crimea wanted to stay "Autonomy within Ukraine," 12% were for "Crimean Tatar autonomy within Ukraine," 2% for "Common oblast of Ukraine," and 23% voted for "Crimea should be separated and given to Russia."[^9]

On 26 February 2014, at the protests near the building of the Crimean parliament 4000–5000 Crimean Tatars and supporters of the Euromaidan-Crimea movement faced 600–700 supporters of pro-Russian organizations and the Russian Unity Party. On the next day, the buildings of the Crimean parliament and the Council of Ministers were seized by the Russian special forces.[^10]

When Moscow’s illegal takeover of Crimea was already completed, the Russian government tried to legitimize annexation through the pseudo referendum***.*** It was unrecognized by the international community through UN General Assembly Resolution 68/262 “Territorial Integrity of Ukraine”,[^11] supported by 100 UN member states. The overwhelming majority of international and human rights organizations, including the United Nations,[^12] the OSCE,[^13] NATO,[^14] as well as Human Rights Watch,[^15] have rejected the referendum.
